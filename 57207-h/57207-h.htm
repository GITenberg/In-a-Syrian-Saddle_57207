<h3>CHAPTER I<br /><br />

<small>GOING TO JERICHO</small></h3>

<p class="center small">"A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Life</span>
is, in many respects, made very easy
in the Holy Land. You can return home
in the afternoon with no anxious forebodings
as to how much waste of time is awaiting you
in the shape of cards and notes on the hall
table; you may wear clothes for covering, you
may eat for nourishment; without taking thought
for fashion in the one case, or of competition
with your neighbour's cook or gardener in
the other. But—according to our Occidental
standards—you cannot consistently indulge any
taste you may happen to have for being grand.
Your attempts at a London, or shall we say a
suburban, drawing-room, your "At Home" days,
your Europeanised service, the dress of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
womankind—distantly reminiscent of the ladies'
papers and of Answers to Correspondents—are
certain to be complicated by some <i>contretemps</i>
provocative only of mirth. The Oriental himself
makes no attempt at being consistent.
When you arrive at his house he spreads a
priceless carpet, but omits to remove last week's
dust from off the furniture; he gives you
perfumed coffee, which is like a dream of
Olympus, and his servant brings you a piece
of bread in his fingers.</p>

<p>These reflections, and many more, were
suggested during the waiting which accompanied
our start in the early sunrise at half-past five
on Saturday, 3rd October 1903. No one could
have guessed how grand we really were, and
there were moments then, and later, when
the fact escaped even our own notice. We
four, the Lady, the Doctor (of various forms
of scholarship) and the two Sportsmen, were
the chosen and proud companions of the
Professor; and the Professor, besides being
the greatest epigraphist in Europe, was the
representative of a Royal Personage, and armed
with all the permits and safe-conducts and
special privileges useful in a land of cholera,
quarantine, and backsheesh. Our eight horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
were innocent of grooming, and their equipment
was fastened together mainly with tin tacks,
pieces of rope, and bits of string; but it
would have been difficult to find in England any
animal to whom you could have proposed, still
less with whom you could have carried through,
one tithe of what our ragged regiment accomplished.
Our two grooms, <i>mukaris</i>, appealed to
certain senses as vaguely horsey, though they suggested
nothing more distinguished than stable-helps;
but their management of eight animals,
under conditions which seemed especially designed
for their destruction, when there was not a blade
of grass, perhaps for a whole day not a drop of
water; when they were ridden for ten, twelve,
or even fourteen hours at a stretch with merely
an hour's rest—without forage—at noon, would
have done credit to any groom at Badminton
or Berkeley. As we proposed to ourselves both
pleasure and profit we took no servants—still
less a dragoman. Our portable food had been
very carefully selected, and was the best obtainable.
Bread, eggs, chickens, grapes, and
lemons we could count upon getting as we
went along.</p>

<p>Each member of the party had clothing and
a blanket in a pair of saddle-bags—mostly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
goats' hair or camels' hair, gaily decorated with
coloured tassels—and these, with an extra pair
for the baskets of food, spirit-lamps, plates,
knives, and tin cups, were distributed among
the three baggage animals, who also carried,
in turn, the two mukaris, perched on the top
of the pile, but capable of climbing up and
down with incredibly rapid agility.</p>

<p>At length the cavalcade was ready, and we
turned our faces towards Jericho. First came
the Professor, on a tall, white Circassian horse,
with a tail which almost swept the ground,
and was dyed with henna for protection from
the Evil One, who was further defied, by each
of us, by means of a large blue bead hanging
round the neck of every horse on a coloured
worsted rope. The Professor himself exhibited
five foot of humanity, mostly brains; a personality
which consisted, to the eye, of a large
scarlet and gold silk <i>keffeeye</i> (head covering)
with a goats' hair <i>akal</i> (rope to keep it in place)
and an elaborate silk fringe, below which emerged
a pair of black leggings, into one of which a whip
was jauntily stuck. He was mounted on a peaked,
military saddle, and he alone of all the party refused
to be separated from his saddle-bags, which
contained an assortment of cigars, cigarettes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
tobacco, and the long wooden pipe, for use in
the saddle, such as is in favour with the Bedu.</p>

<p>Next came the Lady, mounted on a long-legged
Arab steed, several sizes too large for
her, but selected for her use mainly because he
could do the <i>rahwân</i>, the light canter special to
the desert horses, and which reduces fatigue to
a minimum. It was discovered, later in the
day, that he was also capable, apparently, of
running for the Derby, an incident which may
as well be recorded at once, as it resulted in his
banishment to the second class, and the society
of the mukaris.</p>

<p>The road from Jerusalem to Jericho still retains
the character recorded some two thousand
years ago, but the thieves among whom you inevitably
fall are now licensed by the Government.
There is a whole village full of them, called
Abu-dis, and they have the privilege of protecting
travellers from Bethany to Jericho—that
is, of enforcing payment for preventing anyone
else from robbing you. It is but some few
years ago that an Englishman, suspected of
seeking to dispense with this advantage, had
his donkey shot under him. At Bethany, accordingly,
we were joined by our escort, but,
as became our dignity, he was an officer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
picturesquely attired, and mounted, unfortunately,
on a beautiful Arab mare. The misfortune
lay in the fact that all our horses, with
one exception, were stallions, most of whom
became restless and uneasy, that of the Professor
so unmanageable that our escort was compelled
to leave us, and to take to bypaths from which
he could, more or less, keep us in sight. Nevertheless,
even the temporary companionship had
somewhat excited the entire cavalcade. We
were all in good spirits, and it must be confessed
that there was a certain amount of what
may be called "fooling"—-of what we would
not for worlds describe as "showing off," but,
rather, as trying the paces of our steeds—an
amusement which the Professor saw reason,
later, to forbid entirely.</p>

<p>The road to Jericho is a descent of over three
thousand feet, but at a point nearly half way, a long
and steep climb brings you from the transverse
valley Sa'b-el-Meshak to the Khan of the Good
Samaritan. At this point it occurred to the Lady's
horse to have a private exhibition on his own
account, and to set off at a truly breakneck gallop,
with which no other animal in the party could
possibly compete, even had it been wise to follow,
except at a considerable distance. Her strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
was quite inadequate to check him, but in the length
and steepness of the hill lay promise of safety,
and it was with infinite relief that he was seen
to pull up at last. He had no vice, but the
occasion was not one for a steeplechase, and it
was decided that, on the morrow, there should
be a "general post" of horses, the mukari being
made responsible for his Derby winner, and the
Professor arranging, by exchange with one of the
Sportsmen, to ride an animal which would admit
of conversation with the officer, for such attainments
as our leader's have not been achieved
by sitting in a library, or by confinement to the
professorial chair of his university, but rather
by personal intercourse with the Arabs in the
various dialects of their own clans, by life in
the desert, and association with wandering
tribes in the unexplored districts of the Peræa
Haurân and of Central Arabia.</p>

<p>The Sportsmen carried guns, the Doctor a
notebook—though he was more than suspected
of yearning for a rifle,—the revolver which he
carried at his belt being better adapted for
the murder of man than of beast—not that the
murder of man, to judge from the experiences
of earlier travellers, was a wholly improbable contingency.
Our road led us along almost the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
length of the north and east wall of Jerusalem;
we then crossed the bridge over the Kedron
valley—the brook, if any exist, is now far
below the surface; we passed the Garden of
Gethsemane, skirted the southern slope of the
Mount of Olives, hastened past the filthy hovels
of the little village of Bethany, crowned by the
so-called Castle of Lazarus, probably the remains
of a pre-crusading Benedictine convent, and
finally, about seven o'clock, pulled up at what
is known as the Inn of the Apostles' Fountain,
just such a building as a child might draw
upon a slate. As this is the only well between
Bethany and Jericho it may be safely assumed
that the apostles, coming up to Jerusalem,
would drink here, though it is to be hoped that
it was less contaminated than at present; for
even the careless natives strain the water through
a sieve before allowing their animals to drink,
though, nevertheless, they still acquire leeches,
as the bleeding mouths of the camels and
donkeys one meets along the road frequently
betray. The spot has been marked by a
succession of buildings; a little white dome over
the well, and some hewn stones and the ruins
of an aqueduct in the hill across the road, being
all that now remains of its old dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
Passing the Khan of the Good Samaritan—a
modern inn and curiosity shop, at which you
can, at your leisure, renew "a certain man's"
experiences—we paused at the top of the last
hill before descending towards the Jordan valley.
Here the entire neighbourhood was once commanded
by a strong mediæval castle, intended,
like many all over the country, for the defence
of the district. The tribal marks of the Bedu
to be found on its walls are of extreme interest.
The hill upon which it stands is known as
Tel'at ed-Dam, the hill of blood, probably from
the red colour of the rock, though some have
sought to identify it, by reason of the sound of
the name, with the Adummim of Joshua xv. 7.</p>

<p>The view from this point is, in certain details,
absolutely unique. You look down at the lowest
spot upon the earth's surface—the hollow of
the Dead Sea, blue as the sky in the morning
sunshine, flecked with cloudlike wavelets, beautiful,
gay and smiling, but bitter, treacherous, and
the home only of mystery and death. The water
contains about twenty-five per cent. of solid substances;
no organism higher than such microbes as
the bacilli of tetanus can live in it; even swimming
is almost impossible; neither shells nor coral
testify to any happier past. The water boils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
at 221 degrees Fahrenheit, but the presence of
chloride of magnesium makes it incredibly
nauseous, while the oily quality, which it derives
from chloride of calcium, makes any accidental
splash upon the garments very destructive. We
gratefully take in long breaths of air which,
hot and dry as it is, are, we are well aware,
more fresh and sweet than any we are likely
to obtain during the next twenty-four hours, for
only personal experience of the stifling heat
of that unrivalled hollow can make it possible
to realise that six and a half million tons of
water which fall into the Dead Sea—a basin
about the size of the Lake of Geneva, but with
no outlet—have to be daily evaporated. Far
away southward is the great salt district, where
the salt deposit, coated with chalky limestone
and clay, takes many weird forms, among which
the Arabs point out Bint Shech Luth—the woman
of Shech Lot.</p>

<p>"Of whose wickedness, even to this day, the
waste land that smoketh is a testimony, and
plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness,
and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of
an unbelieving soul" (Wisdom x. 7).</p>

<p>"The waste land that smoketh" is a touch of
autopic description which one remembers when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
towards sunset, great wreaths of white mist lie
low in the mountain hollows, as nowhere else in
Judæa. Eastward, the horizon is bounded by
the long chain of the mountains of Moab, which,
ever since our arrival in the country, have seemed
a sort of mysterious dreamland, a limit of knowledge,
the gate of fairyland, the nightly stage
of the great pageant gilded and painted by the
sunset. How often have we longed, like the
youngest brother of the fairy tale, to ride across
the wide plain, and to wander forth for a year
and a day into that dim Unknown! We could
hardly realise that at last the time had come
and we were stepping eastward.</p>

<p>Below us, in the great plain, a meandering
green track shows where the banks of the Jordan
are offering shade and refreshment. In the
nearer foreground the scanty hovels and many
hotels of modern Jericho lie, embowered in
tropical vegetation, and we remember with an
added interest that, within even the next day or
two, we shall pass through districts of three
distinct flora and fauna, and, leaving behind the
oaks and pines, the familiar sparrows and
starlings of our Jerusalem environment, we shall
rest to-night among palms and bananas, we shall
hear the cry of the jackal, and smell the tracks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
of the hyæna, and again, in a couple of days, find
ourselves in desert surroundings, the nursery of
the camel and home of the gazelle, with the scanty
herbage and stalkless flora of an Alpine world.</p>

<p>Looking down upon the Jericho plain we note
various points of interest. We distinguish the
sites of three Jerichos.</p>

<p>First we notice, to the south, the kraal-like
village of to-day, on the site of a castle and
church of the Crusaders, afterwards a flourishing
Moslem town, plundered by Egyptian soldiers
in 1840, and subsequently destroyed by fire in
1871. It seems unlikely that it will ever
recover its former position; for, apart from
apparent absence of all ability for initiation on
the part of the Arabs, the climate seems to have a
degenerating effect upon the inhabitants, Even
German perseverance, which has made habitable
spots in the low maritime plains of Judæa where all
other colonists had failed, could not suffice to
render life here endurable, and an agricultural
settlement organised within the last few years
has literally <i>died</i> out. The Latins—or, as we
say in England, the Roman Catholics—have also
failed to establish themselves, and the Russian
and Greek settlements find existence possible
only under conditions of frequent change, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
the stimulus of the profits to be made out of the
thousands of Russian pilgrims who come, every
year, at Epiphany, for baptism in the Jordan.
Last year, however, the Jordan was held to
have acquired so large a proportion of cholera
bacilli on its way from Tiberias, where there
was a great outbreak of disease, that approach
was justly forbidden by the authorities. To the
west lie the remains of the Jericho of Bible
history, of which, from earliest childhood, most
of us have had a mental picture—the great town
enclosed by walls enwreathed with vegetation,
"that ancient city of palm-trees," few of which
still remain, though they were abundant as late
as the seventh century; and in Jewish amulets,
and marriage or divorce documents, which are
commonly decorated with allegorical pictures,
Jericho is still represented by a group of palms.
South of the Israelitish town, and west of modern
Jericho, are the remains of the Roman Jericho,
which, it is interesting to remember, was presented
by Anthony to Cleopatra, who, characteristically,
promptly sold it to Herod for a winter
home. He made of it a beautiful city, adorned
with palms and gardens, and scented with the
balsams for which it was long famous as an
article of commerce, but which are no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
to be found in Syria, and where, in the time
of Christ, the roadsides were shaded with
sycamores—not the <i>pseudo-platanus</i> with which we
are familiar, and which is not a syc<i>o</i>more at all,
but the <i>ficus sycomorus</i>, the mulberry fig, which,
often attaining the proportions of a handsome
forest tree, still yields its wholesome and refreshing
fruit among the humbler surroundings
of to-day. The remains of a pool, five hundred
and sixty-four feet long, part of an immense
system of conduits still visible, which was the
immediate cause of the fertility and beauty of
the Roman Jericho, is said to indicate the
whereabouts of Herod's palace.</p>

<p>The Jericho of crusading times was, probably,
supplied with water from what is now locally
known as the Ain es-Sultan (the Sultan's Spring),
although its more suggestive name of Elijah's
Fountain is still in use among the Christian
population. Pilgrims of the fourth and fifth
centuries record the tradition that it was here
that the prophet healed the bitter water with
salt. Salt is still thrown into a pool or cistern
which, toward the end of the dry season, is found
to be impregnated with noxious matter, animal
or vegetable. As, before the time of the Roman
water system, there was no other means of supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
it is almost certain that the ancient town must
have stood near this, the only natural spring,
and the site of the house of Rahab, still shown,
may quite well have been in the neighbourhood
indicated.</p>

<p>Rising almost perpendicularly a short distance
beyond the Fountain of Elijah, is the Quarantana
Mountain, first so called by the Crusaders, in
memory of the forty days of the Temptation,
although it seems to have been held sacred
from a much earlier period, as there are remains
of many hermitages, one of which is
said to have been occupied by S. Chariton
about 400 <small>A.D.</small></p>

<p>It is a panorama wonderful not only in extent
but in the amount of detail, which, in the cloudless
air of the East, we are enabled to distinguish,
and we would willingly pause longer, but the
sun is high in the heavens, we have been six
hours in the saddle, and, leaving our horses to
follow, we find a pleasant relief from the glare
in descending an almost perpendicular path into
the Wady Kelt, the deep gorge of the brook
Cherith, where a monastery marks the site of
the alleged hiding-place of the prophet Elijah.
It is perched on a narrow shelf, high up on the
perpendicular rock wall of the ravine, and can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
only have acquired its present resemblance to
domestic architecture by slow and painful labour.
The lower storey, of rough massive stones, apparently
designed for a fortress, is all that remains
of an ancient monastery, founded in 535, possibly
upon the site of an earlier habitation of the Essenes,
an esoteric sect of Jews, whose life somewhat
resembled that of the religious Orders among
Christians. The cave, high up in the face of
the rock, alleged to have been occupied by
Elijah, is now an oratory for the Greek monks,
who, in 1880, returned to an old foundation of
Koziba, and built an upper storey, with projecting
balconies, from which one has a wonderful view
of the gorge below.</p>

<p>We left our horses upon a little bridge, which
spans the bed of the brook—where they found
welcome shelter, after their giddy descent, under
a vine-covered pergola—and then, following a
zigzag path, we made our way within the doors
of one of the many hospitable monasteries which,
all over the Holy Land, are ready to offer at
least shade and water, the two great boons of
a hot country, to the weary and thirsty traveller.
No question was made as to creed, even as to
that of our officer, a Moslem, and we were
allowed to spread the meal we had with us, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
kindly additions of water for drink and ablution,
coffee, liqueur, and fresh green lemons.</p>

<p>Ignoring all question as to whether the prophet
were fed by Arabs or by orabs (ravens) it is
at least a pleasing sight to watch the relations
of the wild birds of the gorge with his
modern representatives. The old superior of
the convent, silent, calm, with an expression of
infinite resignation to the poverty, in every sense,
of his ascetic life, seemed to recover some faint
and passing interest in the beautiful world about
him as, bidding us be silent within the window,
he stepped out on to the balcony, and produced
from his pocket some dried figs. Scarcely raising
his voice, he called gently, <i>Idoo sudar! Idoo
sudar!</i>—or such his cry sounded—Russian, as
we understood, for "Come along, sir!" The
blue air was flecked with gold, a morsel of the
fruit was seized as it was thrown into the air,
there was another flash of golden wings, and
on the head, shoulders, and the extended arms
of the old man there perched the exquisite
blackbirds of the district—the "Tristram's
grakle" of the Dead Sea. The sheen of the
deep purple wing, with its orange lining, was
wonderfully rich, and the creatures themselves
were, in every movement, graceful as swallows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
The dainties finished, there was an instant flutter,
and not a sign remained in all the clear, blue
heaven of our visitors of a moment ago; only
a shimmer of silver on the opposite cliff showed
where a cloud of rock pigeons had descended
to inquire into the cause of excitement among
their neighbours.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours' rest we went on our
way, following the narrow path which crept
along the precipice, and looking with equal
wonderment at the rocky hermitages above our
heads and at those beneath our feet; some which
seemed to be accessible only to birds, while
others were so deep down in the narrow gorge
that the necessaries of life have to be lowered
to them from a roughly-formed crane upon a
narrow shelf of level ground above.</p>

<p>It was interesting to notice that, even among
men of similar religious impulses, and identical
occupations and opportunities, individual character
nevertheless finds occasion for expression.
While some dwelt in holes in the rock, accessible
only by a ladder, sometimes of rope,
and in one case, by a voluntary asceticism, only
by a pole, others showed a tendency to make
the best of the situation—two or three had
constructed gardens, verandahs, or porticos; one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
dwelling at least would have been described
by an auctioneer as a <i>cottage orné</i>, and some
had even shown an æsthetic realisation of what
was befitting the situation, and had sought
after effects of colour and form as well as of
convenience. Not a human being was to be
seen, but we wondered how many pairs of eyes
were watching our movements; whether it were
possible that the sound of our cheery voices,
and the sight of our enjoyment, may not have
touched some heart to sense of loss, have
sounded some chord of regret, or even of remorse,
have recalled memories of other days,
when friendship and anticipation and sympathy
and glad companionship were theirs, and life
was other than the awaiting of death, and the
setting sun brought a sense of something added
to the days that were gone as well as of something
subtracted from such as might—in God's
providence—remain.</p>

<p>Our horses followed slowly down the glen,
and the afterglow was beautifying even the
desolate village of Jericho as we finally remounted
and rode in among the groves of
orange and banana.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
Jericho hotels were closed for the season,
but with the connivance of the negro caretaker
and of an Arab in charge of the adjoining
orange-gardens we obtained entrance at one,
and managed to provide ourselves with firing
and an excellent supper, and, subsequently, with
beds. The Lady, who alone of the party carried
a watch, heard the negro awakening the Professor
next morning with the information that it was
three o'clock, and added greatly to her popularity
by being in a position to call out an assurance
that it was only one, and that two hours' further
repose was permissible. The building, it should
be mentioned, being constructed mainly of wood
and of mud bricks was well adapted for distant
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
Three o'clock, however, duly arrived, all too
soon, and by four o'clock we had breakfasted
and were on our way across the sandy plain
which stretches for about two hours between
Jericho and the Jordan. A few faint streaks in
the east promised the coming day, but it was
still so dark that our horses required all our
attention, as the plain is full of holes; twice
over a silver gleam ahead warned us of fords
to be crossed, and from time to time dark
masses rose up before us, and those riding in
advance called to the others to avoid the spreading
branches of the jujube-tree, <i>zizyphus lotus</i> and
<i>zizyphus spina Christi</i>, called by the Arabs
<i>nebk</i> and <i>sidr</i>, which are the octopods of vegetable
life, sending out long tentacles armed with
fierce thorns, capable of subtracting your head-gear,
entering your saddle, and imprisoning your
horse.</p>

<p>The ride across the plain of Jordan, interesting
at any time to persons of imagination, was unspeakably
weird and suggestive in the morning
twilight, but we differed as to whether the
world in which we found ourselves was one
in course of construction or of disintegration.
Some of us were of opinion that the giant sand-hills—a
labyrinth of marl and salt deposit, worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
by winds and washed by winter torrents, an old
sea bottom—which crumble at a touch, and which
resemble castles, churches, towers, domes, minarets,
whole towns of every variety of architecture,
suggested an artist's dream of a world to be;
while others maintained that they were the
images, in the mind of a philosopher, dwelling
upon the past. There was no limit to the tricks
which fancy might play in such surroundings,
a nearer <i>fata morgana</i>; a dream materialised
as it created itself; a poem precipitated as it
was sung: castles in Spain in which each of us
saw some reminder of his personal aspirations:
the land of By-and-by; the ruins of Yesterday;
the house of Never, according to our individual
temperament and faculty.</p>

<p>Riding was not very rapid during the first
hour and more, so that it was nearly seven
o'clock when we reached the Jordan bridge—the
Rubicon between Palestine and Moab, an
exceedingly rickety wooden structure, of which
the only effective part is the door at either end,
designed for the enforcement of backsheesh.
The river is embowered in trees, a variety of
willow known as the <i>safsaf</i>, various acacias,
the <i>farnesiana</i>, not yet filling the air with its
delicious scent, the <i>tortilis</i>, and <i>seyal</i>—with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
long spines, which are found even on many
plants innocent as lambs elsewhere, but fully
armed in this land of thorns and thistles—the
<i>zakkum</i>, resembling a large box-tree, also provided
with strong thorns, the inevitable jujube
<i>zizyphus</i>, the crimson-flowered oleander, which
is as seldom out of blossom as is the gorse on
our English moors, above all, the Jordan tamarisk,
inseparable in one's memory from this river and
its surroundings, green, graceful, and, in comparison
with its many-armed and aggressive
neighbours, gentle and friendly.</p>

<p>We had plenty of leisure to observe these
details, for our arrangements with the guardians
of the bridge involved not only inquiry, discussion,
and the gratification of considerable curiosity
but also consumption of coffee and distribution
of backsheesh. The scene about us was animated
and full of variety. The bridge may
not be crossed before sunrise, and our arrival
was timely, for types of the whole desert population
seemed to have just arrived, and were
pausing to reorganise their caravans. A group
of fellahin, the agricultural labourers of the
country, were bargaining with the Bedu, whose
lands they are employed to cultivate at a wage
of one-third of the profits, for the Bedu toil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
not neither do they spin. They are the sons
of the desert, freedom is their birthright, and
the fellah, compared with them, is as the "linnet
born within the cage" to one who has always
"known the summer woods." With his scanty
white robe, his black head-cloth or keffeeye, his
huge akal of camels' hair, he is probably not less
ragged than the blue-robed fellah, but he has
an air of indescribable dignity. Utterly independent
of his surroundings, he is as unaffected
by hunger or the absence of all the necessaries
of life, as a Highland chief, and, like him, is proud
not of the mere outside conditions of life but,
literally, of the blood in his veins. "I suppose
you are descended from Abraham?" someone
remarked to an old Bedawin of this district.</p>

<p>"Oh no; Abraham was not at all of good
family," he replied.</p>

<p>The Circassians, too, are there, with wide-skirted
coats and astrachan caps; the Turcomans,
with flashes of scarlet and yellow where Arabs
would be wearing white or blue—to say nothing
of certain Government officials, savouring of
town life, in tarbush and European boots.</p>

<p>Various animals of the desert are there:
camels that are graceful and asses that are
intelligent; horses with the manes and tails
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
which Nature intended for them; stallions of the
fellahin and mares of the Bedu; oxen and goats
and sheep and, as link with the wilder creatures,
the pariah dog and the feral cat. There is a
whole armoury of weapons, mostly of the kind
adapted for a provincial museum, from a matchlock
to a modern breech-loader, from a two-edged
dagger to a cavalry sabre, from a horn-handled
kitchen knife to the dainty instrument with
which, with some futility, one of the party is
manicuring his nails.</p>

<p>We begin to realise that we have said goodbye
not only to roads, and sheets and tablecloths,
but almost to humanity, for it seems
as if the entire population were leaving the
country towards which our faces are set. There
is shouting in half-a-dozen languages—our own
little party habitually provides five—there is the
utter disorder combined with the perfect courtesy,
which contrasts so strongly with the general
order and personal indifference, of what we of
the West suppose to be a higher civilisation.</p>

<p>The Lady showed her sense of the new order
of things by betaking herself to a second stirrup;
for, when you have to hang on to precipices
by your eyelids, climb pathless mountains in
the dark, descend over solid rock, slippery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
defenceless, or over shale which disappears beneath
your horse's feet; when you may expect
to be ten, twelve, or even fourteen hours a day
in the saddle—and such a saddle as one is
likely to obtain in the East—a Hyde Park seat
does not afford all the security and convenience
which anxious friends can desire. There
was not enough leather in our outfit to go round,
and as that second stirrup hung on by a piece
of string it afforded an excellent measure of
temperature, distance, and individual mood.
"When in doubt" upon any question—if someone
were desperate for a halt, when the party
became scattered and consequent waiting provided
a few odd minutes of spare time, when
conversation failed or anyone were aching for
occupation, if any member of the party had a
sudden access of politeness and wished to exhibit
interest or pay a little attention to the
suddenly-remembered female sex—there was
always that second stirrup to fall back upon.
In the morning the string had lengthened with
the night-dews, but as the day went on and
each cavalier had added an attentive knot,
the rider would allege that she had become as
lopsided as a London milkwoman. By-and-by
the knots tautened, the perpetual pull of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
thousand feet of ascent or descent, as the case
might be, strained the string to its utmost, and
the stirrup became inaccessible; after dusk she
was suspected of dispensing with it altogether.
The whole position was an excellent illustration
of the misfit of the privileges claimed as
"women's rights!" Nevertheless, it said something
for the worth of the compromise, that
she never once dismounted on account of the
nature of the ground, that she brought home
her animal with sound knees, that both horse
and rider came back as fresh as they started,
and that the company were loud in declaring
that their patience was unexhausted and that
they were ready, if any shred survived, to begin
operations again upon that string to-morrow.</p>

<p>The Professor and the Lady had both changed
horses; he for one which, however much elated
by his position, could yet be induced to behave
discreetly in the neighbourhood of the Bedawi
mare; she for one which, although incapable of
the much-vaunted <i>rahwân</i>, could nevertheless
be kept within such bounds as befitted ascent
of pathless precipices, and progress over the
dry beds of mountain streams. It was probably
owing to the superior lightness of the burden
he had to carry that her new steed, Sadowi, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
light-limbed grey, was, like his predecessor, generally
ahead of all the party. The Professor's long-legged
mount and the active wide-flanked slender-headed
mare of the officer, were of course
the official leaders of the expedition, and the
Lady did her utmost to sustain a modest retirement
into the background. But her task
was not easy, not only because of the personal
ambitions of Sadowi, but on account of certain
human vices on the part of the Professor's
horse, for which the usual <i>cherchez la femme</i>
was the occasion. The Bedawy beauty, with
whom he carried on an active flirtation, was,
on Oriental principles, <i>haram</i> (forbidden) to
anyone else, and he refused to tolerate the
neighbourhood of any other horse, looking
round perpetually with an evil expression of
suspicion and hatred, worthy only of his human
superiors. When Sadowi passed him he turned
aside to bite him in the act; when the Lady
succeeded in keeping in the rear he kicked
out at irregular intervals, on the chance of the
proximity of his rival.</p>

<p>The coffee served to us pending our arrangements
at the Jordan bridge was more than
welcome, for we had almost forgotten our half-past-three-o'clock
breakfast, and the feast of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
eye ceased, after a time, to suffice the appetite.
Some of us had built our hopes on private stores
of chocolate; but chocolate, in the East, even
in October, has its drawback, from a tendency
to trickle out of the corners of one's pockets in
tell-tale streams which are not appetising. The
humble peppermint, of the quality stamped
"Extra Strong," reminiscent of the smell of afternoon
church in the country, may rather be recommended,
as allaying both hunger and thirst, the
latter probably by stimulus of the salivary gland.
Meat lozenges and other devices of the amateur
traveller share the fate of the chocolate; bread
becomes rusk and, like biscuit, is provocative of
thirst; raisins, except of the kind which at home
we dedicate to puddings, are, strange to say,
unknown; and figs and dates with no water
to wash them in, are—here where we know
their antecedents—for most of us out of the
question. One of our mukaris went about
with a necklace of figs threaded on a string,
from which he subtracted as occasion suggested.
He had learned the art of the simplification
of life: he drank almost anything that
was wet, ate as has been described, never, so
far as was known, undressed, and slept anywhere
except, apparently, in a bed, but for choice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
on the top of one of the baggage animals whenever
the road in any degree approached the
horizontal. His only luxury was his water-pipe,
which he produced at every moment of leisure,
trusting to his companion to keep it alight
without any unnecessary expenditure of <i>tombak</i>,
the special tobacco used for the narghile, whenever
duty called him away. He was to such a
degree a man of resource and expedient that
a story which the Professor told us, though, as
a matter of fact, observed elsewhere, might
just as well have been applied to him. Some
mukari in the Professor's employ had also a
water-pipe, but seems to have been fastidious,
which Khalil was not, and on one occasion was
seen looking around for something which might
be conveniently inserted into the bottle-shaped
vase which holds the water, and in which a
ring of scum had formed upon the glass. His
eye fell upon a neighbouring donkey. He
seized the beast's tail, twisted it into a convenient
bottle brush, performed the required
ablution, and returned it to the astonished
owner, who, however, with the usual intelligence
of the Palestine ass, made no remark upon the
subject.</p>

<p>In Syria the greatest difficulty in locomotion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
except backsheesh, for which it is the pretext,
is quarantine. It is easy enough to cross the
Jordan bridge eastward on payment of a toll
of three piasters (about 7d.), for man and beast,
but it may not be so easy to get back again,
as quarantine may be imposed at any hour, and
may last for any length of time. It was necessary,
therefore, to make it clear to the official mind
that, by special favour, we were to be allowed
to return without let or hindrance, whatever
might have occurred in the interval. That, in
the name of Allah, would be as Allah and
certain exalted persons willed, we were piously
assured, and finally, with much hand-shaking
and invocation—May peace go with you! May
your path be broad! May your day be blessed!—the
gates were opened, and in a few minutes
we were east of the River Jordan, which in the
rainy season is at least one hundred feet wide, but
was now only one-third of that distance.</p>

<p>A plain some four or five hours broad—for
here all measurement is by time, at the rate of
three or four miles an hour, according to the
nature of the country—lay between us and the
foot of the hills, although during all the months
we had looked longingly at them from the
hills of Judæa they had seemed to rise almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
perpendicularly from the banks of the Jordan
and of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>Our destination before nightfall was Madaba,
which lies 2940 feet above sea level. Starting
from the valley of the Dead Sea, 1292 feet
below the Mediterranean, and with the wide
plain of the Jordan valley to cross before the
ascent could begin, it was evident we must reserve
our force for the precipitous climb of over
4000 feet which awaited us, and we accordingly
kept our horses in check, although the sandy
plain offered temptation for a canter. We had
abundance of interest. The Sportsmen hardly
expected to meet with the lions which formerly
infested the thickets of the Jordan, but traces
of wild boar might be looked for, also hyænas,
jackals, and foxes (which it is considered
legitimate to <i>shoot</i>) both the desert fox, <i>canis
niloticus</i>, and the <i>canis variegatus</i>, smaller than
the English fox, with a grey back, black
breast, and a large bushy tail. Cheetahs are
occasionally found in the district we were
approaching, the wild cat, <i>felis caligata</i>, though
rare, is not unknown, of gazelles we should
doubtless see plenty in the mountains, the ibex,
with huge horns, might be expected among the
rocks of the highest points; and the sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
a wolf was not wholly impossible. However,
the immediate expectation, considering the
hour, the place, and the sounds which accompanied
our cavalcade—for nothing short of
personal danger can silence an Arab—was
rather of bird than of beast. The first prize
in the mind of the Sportsmen was the francolin,
much valued in Syria as a pot-shot. It is
something between a pheasant and a partridge,
of dark grey plumage, very strong both to run
and fly, and with a powerful call. Partridges,
too, came within their ambitions, and the
partridge of Syria is indeed game worth the
powder. Down here, in the plains, the Hey's
partridge, <i>ammoperdix heyi</i>, with its delicate
plumage, a soft grey touched with richest blue,
is the most common; but as we advance the
larger Greek partridge, the <i>caccabis saxatilis</i>,
awaits us, among the rocks and boulders of
the mountain passes. Pigeons and sand-grouse,
and the large Indian turtle-dove, <i>turtur risorius</i>,
were abundant, but the wedge-tailed raven,
<i>corvus affinis</i>, with his whistling cry and jackdaw-like
air of gaiety, did not show until we
reached the cliffs of a higher district.</p>

<p>The Lady openly exulted in the lack of accessible
game, and grudged even the occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
shots fired, as disturbing to the smaller creatures
in which she found delight—the grakle, the
blackbird with orange under wings with whom
we had already made friends by the brook
Cherith, whose bell-like note sounded from tree
to tree, the dainty sun-bird, <i>cinnyris oseæ</i>, whose
metallic sheen flashed in and out of the tamarisk-trees,
the delicate—hued Moabite sparrow, the
aristocrat of his family, who ran up reeds and
tree trunks like the familiar tits at home. We
were too early to see the flights of birds of
passage on their way south to warmer climes,
and which, before and after the winter months,
pause in the thickets of the Jordan basin, and
fill the air with music, which includes the notes
of the cuckoo and the nightingale, and recalls,
however irrelevantly, Browning's "Oh, to be
in England, now that April's here!" We had
hoped to see the busy little jerboa, a jumping
mouse with long hind legs, like a microscopic
kangaroo, but circumstances were, for the present,
against us, chiefly the noise of our cavalcade.
He is a friendly little beast, and easily
tamed, and though familiar with him in confinement
we should have liked to see him under
happier conditions.</p>

<p>We could not have happened on a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
unfortunate season for flowers; the wonderful
flora of the Jordan valley was now at rest, and
even the autumn squills, the delicate muscari,
and a few lingering silenae had been left behind
on the higher ground the other side of Jericho.
The only feast of colour was the oleander,
familiar to most of us as a greenhouse shrub,
and which here rose with its rich crimson or
pure white flowers, single or double, wherever
a little water remained to keep the earth moist
about its roots. We speculated as to what might
be its nearest cousin in our northern latitudes,
and the wildest guesses were made, including the
rhododendron, mezereum, daphne, and syringa,
but no one thought of the familiar periwinkle,
with its shining trails and sapphire blooms, in
habit and appearance so utterly dissimilar, but
which also belongs to the family of <i>apocynacea</i>,
or dog-bane. In spite of its rich colouring and
welcome beauty, the oleander bush is highly
poisonous, affecting even the water in which it
grows. A story is told of some French soldiers
in the Peninsular War who utilised some of its
twigs to serve as spits for roasting meat, with
the result that seven out of twelve who ate of
it shortly died.</p>

<p>We knew better than to expect to find "Jericho
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
roses" in the Jericho district, although this
curious and interesting crucifer <i>anastatica</i> exists
in considerable quantities about Masada, towards
Engedi, some twenty hours south. It is an
annual, and its curious blossoms are formed in
the spring. We found, however, many specimens
of the Dead Sea fruit, though still green
and unripe. It is an asclepiad, <i>calotropis procera</i>,
called by the Arabs <i>oshr</i>, and is strictly subtropical.
The fruit, the "apple of Sodom" of
Josephus, has an inflated, leathery skin, which,
when crushed, leaves in the hand only fibres
and bits of rind. The stalk has a strong milky
juice. The name is also given to the <i>solanum
sanctum</i>, of the family of the potato, which also
resembles an apple, and is red, with black seeds.</p>

<p>Tristram has happily described the high
lands above the Jordan valley as a "watershed
... the fruitful mother of many infant wadys,"
a <i>wady</i> being a river bed, and as we made our
way along the Wady Heshban, almost due east,
turning southward later in the day, we had
glimpses of many of these glens, and we even
forded a couple of streams on their way down
to the Jordan before, towards noon, we found
ourselves at the foot of the mountains. A clear
running stream, a little grove of trees, were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
temptation not to be resisted. In a moment
we were off our horses, although, unfortunately,
not in time to prevent the baggage animals—left
for an instant by the mukaris, who hastened
to receive our weary steeds—from refreshing
themselves in their own fashion, by a roll in
the cool water, oblivious of their encumbrances,
or, possibly, possessed of some vague notion of
debarrassing themselves of a superfluity. They
had been travelling between seven and eight
hours, and for the last two in intense heat, not
only overhead but, from radiation of the light
sandy soil, underfoot. We could not feel angry
with them, and all cheerfully helped the Lady
to hang her entire wardrobe and personal belongings
upon the projecting branches of the
jujube-trees, useful for once, as it was her
saddle-bags which had suffered most, although
a supply of cake, gingerbread, and chocolate was
reduced to a condition uneatable by any but the
mukaris, who considered the incident an acceptable
dispensation of Providence, or, in their
own phrase, <i>maktoub</i>—"it is decreed."</p>

<p>A few Bedu under the farther trees were
the first human beings we had met since leaving
Jericho except some camel-drivers who,
silent and statuesque, their flocks of many scores
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
of stately camels equally silent and pictorial,
had seemed rather to be a part of the landscape
than to have any human relation with ourselves.
One of the group came forward, and greeted us
in such fluent German that we at first took him
for some agricultural speculator buying seed or
seeking labourers from among the fellahin; for
the agriculture—that is the organised, not to
say scientific, agriculture of Palestine—is practically
in the hands of Germans and Jews. However,
he turned out to be a native, educated at
one of the many German schools of Jerusalem,
or elsewhere, at one time an employé of the
Austrian post office, on his way, alone, with a
dagger and a revolver for sole companions, to
visit some property at Madaba. On hearing
that this was our destination he begged permission
to join our cavalcade, which the Professor
readily granted, as the remaining journey, among
the mountains, was especially solitary. We were
very grateful for coffee and an excellent lunch
of sausage, potted meat, and jam, with white
bread, brought from Jerusalem, the last European
bread we were likely to see. We ate our dainties
with some sense of guilt, and a shamefaced
sensation of geographical and historical anachronism,
as the Professor, without waiting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
our feast to be unpacked and spread, produced
from some secret recess three parcels, one of
which was laid aside for the moment, though
with a promissory glance at the Lady, which she
knew denoted instruction in view. The other
two proved to be bags, one containing dates,
the other figs, "Dates and figs," we were
informed, "were the natural food of desert
wanderers, sufficing to the body, stimulating to
the mind; the wheat, the flesh, above all the
alcohol, of civilisation, were mere irrelevancies."
Here some of us sought to conceal our sandwiches
and withdraw our anticipations from private
flasks. "Was it not diet such as this," and he
waved a pair of sensitive hands over his ascetic
larder, "which had enabled him to reply to the
inquiry of a Personage as to how many hours
a day he could ride in the desert—'Twenty-four,
your Majesty, since the day does not
contain twenty-five, and a man will endure anything
for the sake of his miserable life'? For
was it not on a diet of figs and dates that he
had ridden sixty hours without dismounting,
resting only for two hours, when he dropped
out of the saddle, just one hour's ride from
friends and safety? Was it your meat-eater,
your wine-drinker, who remained sound and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
wholesome when necessity obliged him to refrain
from ablution for twenty-one days? 'If a man
must be a pig or die of thirst, your Majesty,'
he had submitted to the Personage in question,
'will he not rather be a pig?' a sentiment with
which even royalty heartily concurred." At this
point he carefully counted his date stones, observed
that two more were yet due to his appetite,
and, having finished his frugal luncheon, drew
from the saddle-bag deposited beside him his
native pipe, some eighteen inches long, of which
the clay head and wooden stem were carefully
and separately wrapped in paper, filled it with
strong tobacco, and lighted it with a mysterious
paper match, laid atop, which smouldered for a
perceptible time, and set fire to the precious fuel.
Someone, anxious, perhaps, for the just distribution
of human praise and blame, unwisely murmured
that "tobacco was a luxury." The Professor
withdrew his pipe to describe the less costly
"smokes" of desert life. The paths across the
desert of Central Arabia have been the same,
probably, since the earliest ages. Man, camel-mounted,
with the same dress, food, purpose,
habits, has crossed those golden sands for æons
as, and where, he crosses them now. The living
of to-day are treading the dust of yesterday,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
and amid that dust we may look not only for
bleached bones and hypophosphates, but even
for the decomposed dust of camel droppings.
These, dried and purified, it may be, by centuries,
are the substitute for tobacco of desert life. The
Professor would not acknowledge any ability
to give a personal opinion of its quality, but the
Sportsmen, adventurous in this as in all else,
were suspected later, when we reached the camel
district, of making a personal experiment in the
interests of science, with what results it was
never revealed.</p>

<p>The Professor emptied his pipe, and, calling
the attention of the Lady, opened his third parcel,
which proved to contain a large square of white
net. "Such a treasure as this," he admonished
her, "you would do well to acquire. It is a
luxury of travel. When I wish for repose I
envelop myself. It averts flies and mosquitoes,
and is a hint to my companions that I do not
desire conversation." So saying, he modestly
withdrew into its folds, and only a neat little
pair of black boots emerging from—apparently—a
bridal veil, remained to indicate his personality.</p>

<p>The rest of us drew our keffeeyes before
our eyes, laid our heads upon any sloping substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
that offered itself, and neither man nor
beast needed further inducement to enter into
the land of dreams.</p>

<p>At two o'clock we were again in the saddle,
conscious of between 3000 and 4000 feet to
climb. Our faces were set eastward, but we
knew that we had to reach a point above and
beyond Mount Nebo, which lay immediately
south, "to climb where Moses stood, and view
the landscape o'er." Very soon the shrubs,
which had hitherto been at least our occasional
companions, were left behind, and, perpetually
climbing, we began to realise that we had
entered a new world. The limestone, dolomite,
and gravel limestone of Judæa had largely given
place to a formation different alike in colour
and outline—mainly red sand-stone, often of
very fantastic features, and a certain amount
of basalt—later, as we came still farther south,
masses of green-stone and boulders of pudding-stone.
The green-stone is embedded in and
streaked with a deep olive grey, but in places
is as green as malachite. Tristram points out
that a dip in the strata brings the limestone
again in places to the surface, which probably
accounts for the varied colouring of the cliffs—black,
red, and white—which, in the clear, brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
sunshine, is dazzling in its effect. The great
tableland of Moab lies about 4000 feet above
the Dead Sea valley, and slopes gently eastward
for some twenty-five miles, beyond which rises
another range of hills (limestone), the watershed
of Moab, and the frontier of Arabia, whose
blue distances we afterwards came to feel as a
new limitation, which we longed to cross, as
formerly we had longed to cross the hills of
Moab.</p>

<p>For miles we saw no sign of human life,
no cultivation, no domestic animal, only wide
stretches of bare rock and a scant vegetation,
which seemed, although so burnt as to be
difficult to distinguish, mainly sandwort and
soapwort. Now and then a flash of shadow
showed that a lizard had darted away, but even
small birds were rare. When the wide zigzag,
which always seemed to turn horizontally just
as we had begun to make advance, allowed us,
from time to time, to cast glimpses westward
at the mountains of Judæa, we were much astonished
at their height and grandeur. A prophet
has no honour in his own country, and we had
no conception that the familiar range would have
so much dignity from afar. Finally, we reached
a tableland, a wide terrace, before arriving at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
the foot of the farther range of mountains, which
we must still pass.</p>

<p>We halted beneath a solitary tree, and were
thankful for the contents of our water-bottles.
Glass bottles cased with straw and packed in
saddle-bags were almost hot enough to make
tea from, whereas the German military flasks of
the Sportsmen, with felt coverings damped before
starting, and hooked to the saddle, provided a
deliciously cool drink. Mount Nebo, which had
all day dominated the landscape southwards to
our right, had much dwindled in importance,
and indeed the end of our journey would bring
us to an elevation 600 feet its superior; and
there are indeed many points from which Moses
might have had a much finer panorama of the
promised land than that conventionally pointed
out.</p>

<p>Very soon we begin to climb the farther and
final range, and to enter into a district in which
the human interest again awoke, not the less
strongly that it was connected with a past which,
in England, we should consider remote, but
which we describe here as "merely Roman"—that
is to say, not quite two thousand years ago.
The Roman road, which we followed for some
distance, is in much better condition than, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
example, the road between Jerusalem and Jaffa,
or Jerusalem and Bethlehem, in spite of the heavy
road tax which, theoretically, keeps them in order,
and the milestones, though prostrate, are still of
imperial dignity—massive columns some six or
eight feet in height.</p>

<p>Other columns and great hewn stones are
scattered here and there by the roadside, telling
of a grandeur that is past, of a civilisation with
which we have nothing to compare. Another
chapter in human history had been recently
suggested by a great dolmen, worthy of Stonehenge;
some of us longed to turn aside to
examine it more closely, as it was the first we
had seen in this country, although they are very
abundant east of Jordan, especially in the district
lying between Heshbon and the hot springs
of Callirhoe.</p>

<p>An almost perpendicular climb, which the
heavier among the party thought it only merciful
to accomplish on foot, brought us to the
summit of the farther range, the Tell el Matâba,
marked by an extensive stone circle, from whence
we practically looked down on Mount Nebo, and
soon found ourselves in entirely changed surroundings.
Here and there signs of cultivation,
a couple of fellahin carrying a plough, a donkey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
bearing a sack of grain and driven by women,
all spoke of the neighbourhood of human habitation.
A great plateau gently sloping upward
to the east, the fertile Ard 'Abdallah, lay open
before us, and we knew that beyond the gentle
slopes lay the city of Madaba, of which, at
present, there was no indication, except that
of the industry of its inhabitants—or at least
the industry which its neighbourhood made possible.
On a slight eminence stood the tomb of
'Abdallah, of whom we could learn only that
he was a great shech, as was testified by the
symbols displayed upon his tombstone: a mortar
for preparing, an iron spoon for roasting, a pot for
boiling, and a cup for drinking, the coffee, which
was the symbol of his unlimited hospitality.</p>

<p>Thoughts crowded into our minds with rapid
confusion. We had seen too much; disentanglement
was difficult. The stone circle, the dolmen
burial monument of some primeval race, may
have been looked upon by Moses in those sad,
closing hours of a disappointed life—by Balaam
and Balak wandering from point to point, from
one high place of Baal to another, among these
hills, seeking for some spot whence the prophet
might feel himself inspired to curse the tents of
Israel, who had made such havoc up yonder in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
Heshbon, and along the very wady we had
crossed. We remembered how the cities of
Moab were described by Ezekiel as "the glory
of the country," and yet how her inhabitants
were warned by Jeremiah "to flee and get away,
for the cities thereof shall be desolate." We
saw, in fancy, the Roman soldiers of the tenth
legion, the military colonies, the Græco-Roman
culture, the Christian, the Persian influence;
finally, in strange rivalry with powers so strong,
so highly developed, the Arab, who for thirteen
hundred years has lived among the ruins of the
past, not, on the whole, actively destructive but
living only for each day's need; initiating
nothing, saving nothing from decay, not even
seeking to preserve a tree or repair a cistern,
and whose finest monument, among all these
ruins of the past, is that of a shech who dispensed
much coffee! He has held the country
longer than anyone else, as the eagle his eyrie
or the wolf his lair, and as we advanced each
day farther and farther into the desolation of
the present, more and more closely in touch
with the traces of the grandeur of the past, we
felt that here, at least, was a race perfectly
adapted to the environment it had, in great
degree, created for itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
Our tired horses, conscious of twelve hours
of work already past, were thankful for level
ground, and took fresh heart as we pursued
a fairly good path, between wide expanses of
fields, in which the harvest was not yet entirely
over; that wonderful Syrian harvest, which seems
to be going on continuously, here or there,
during quite half the year, from May to October.
We, also weary, let the reins fall loose and
wandered on thus meditating, the Professor and
our officer to the front, the mukaris bringing
up the rear. Suddenly we were conscious of
a slight shock to our body corporate, and, looking
up, perceived that the Professor and the officer
were in colloquy with a body of some six or
eight wild-looking Arabs, their swarthy countenances
looking the darker and more savage for
their black keffeeyes and akals.</p>

<p>At this moment our Sportsmen rode up, one
of whom spoke Arabic like a native, and the
Professor, waving a dignified negative, rode
ahead. We joined him, and turning our horses
looked back at the scene in progress. The
leader of the attacking party was in hot argument
with the Sportsman, who responded to
his shouts and gestures with the cool imperturbability
which, of all European characteristics,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
is most surprising to the Arab, while our
mukaris, hastily collecting the baggage animals,
and casting an anxious glance ahead at the
horses we were riding, hovered timorously in
the rear. As a mere accidental coincidence we
observed that another of the band had fallen
upon an unlucky fellah, who rode up at the
moment, knocked him off his donkey, and was
beating him—casually as it appeared—but probably
<i>pour encourager les autres</i>—namely, our
mukaris. They demanded, as we afterwards
learnt, a tax upon every horse in our company
before permitting us to enter the town of
Madaba, which they represented. "If you belong
to Madaba then accompany us to Madaba,
where we will pay any tax which appears to be
just," replied our Sportsman calmly, "but it
seems to me you are highwaymen," and so
saying he, with our other Sportsman, our second
mukari with two baggage animals, and our
German-speaking Arab companion, rode on,
and joined our distant group, Khalil, our chief
mukari, who was held responsible for all the
horses, being retained as hostage. With the
usual cowardice of an Arab, in spite of the
Sportsman's assurances that he would "see him
through," he very foolishly produced his purse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
satisfied their demands, and rode on triumphant.
The chatter that ensued among our three Arab
companions—for nothing in the world excites
an Arab like a question of money—can only
be compared to a rookery at sunset. One had
a rare opportunity of appreciating the alleged
variety of the Arabic vocabulary; its adaptation
to utterances of anger, vituperation, and regret.
"They claimed, they got, fifty-nine piasters" was
the burden of the song, and we had it in solo,
antiphon, chorus, refrain, with a hundred variations,
all the rest of the way to Madaba. On
our arrival we found that our brigands belonged
to Es-Salt, a town eight hours N.E. of Jericho
(Madaba being a good ten hours S.E.), and
entirely unconnected with this district; that the
tax which they claimed was a war tax, just now
enforced by the Government upon every man
in his own town, so that our poor Khalil would
have to pay it over again on his return to
Jerusalem. With this fact, however, we did
not at present acquaint him.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">After</span>
fourteen hours in the saddle we were
thankful to dismount at the friendly door
of the presbytery at Madaba, where, by kind
permission of the Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem,
we were admitted to enjoy the hospitality of the
parish priest, a Piedmontese, and his assistant,
an Arab, both speaking excellent French, as
well as Italian, the official language of the
patriarchal clergy.</p>

<p>We found their reception room crowded with
a group of some dozen villagers, prominent
among whom was a dignified-looking shech,
who at once claimed acquaintance with the
Professor, and proved to have been his guide
in this district upon a former occasion. He
was engaged in a discussion with the priests,
which we had evidently interrupted, and the
moment opportunity permitted he returned to
his point. There was nothing discourteous in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
his persistence, he was obviously attempting to
make a bargain, and the price offered had
already, we were told, reached 200 francs.
The priest met all his advances with a decided
negative, which grew more and more imperative
as time went on, but time is of no value to an
Arab, and we could not but be reminded of the
parable of the importunate widow. After a time,
at the express desire of our hosts, they all
withdrew into an outer room while we enjoyed
our much-needed refreshment, but when we
afterwards went out to look about us they returned
to the charge, and we even found them
still at it next morning. The very delicate
point at issue was afterwards explained to us.
The man, a member of the Eastern branch of
the Church, desired to marry his niece, and
having failed—after perhaps equal pertinacity in
enforcing his point—in obtaining permission from
his own priest had come to see whether it might
be worth his while to change his religious views,
in hope of receiving the sanction of the Latins.
Apparently he thought the real question at issue
was "How much?"—and from time to time,
after consultation with his companions, he would
raise his bid by a few piasters. Again and
again the priests roundly assured him it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
of no avail; he was not to be convinced, and
when we finally rode away he was sitting on
a stone by the door of the presbytery. It would
have been interesting to know what were the
special attractions of the lady for whom he was
willing to venture so much.</p>

<p>Madaba may best be described as a village
of what, in England, we should call "squatters."
They are Christian exiles from the Moslem town
of Kerak, who, about 1880, took possession of
a city which had been in ruins some thirteen
hundred years, having been devastated, according
to a learned monograph upon the subject
by the Dominican Père Séjourné, most probably
by Chosroes, in his destructive march to or
from the north. The present population, of
some 900, of whom about two-thirds are
Greeks, the rest Latins, occupies a small hill
about 100 feet in height, of which almost a
third is debris. The new residents, in digging
for foundations, have brought to light a great
deal that is of extreme interest and, as naturally
follows, have destroyed still more. Dr Bliss,
referring to the article of Père Séjourné, and
describing the town in 1895, observes that
certain ruins have disappeared in the meantime,
and we, in turn, failed to find others which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
appear in the sketches of Professor Brünnow,
also of 1895.</p>

<p>Madaba is undoubtedly a place very precious
to the archæologist; to the merely æsthetic it
is disappointing and sad. The ruin, the débris,
the desecration, the filth of the last quarter of
a century force themselves upon our consciousness
to a degree difficult to overcome, and it
requires an effort, of which we were little conscious
elsewhere, to realise its former dignity.
When Joshua was old and well stricken in
years it must have been a little discouraging
to him to learn that, besides other large tracts of
country in this district, "all the plain of Madaba
unto Dibân" remained to be possessed. Mesha,
King of Dibân, over six hours' ride to the
south, mentions upon the famous Moabite stone
(897 <small>B.C.</small>) that it belonged to the Israelites in
his period, the reign of Omri, but it afterwards
passed into the possession of the Moabites, and,
still later, into that of the Nabateans, who came
hither from the south of Arabia. Madaba withstood
Hyrcanus during a siege of six months
about a century before Christ, and, during the
Christian era, was the seat of a bishopric.
Early in the seventh century, like many places
on this side of Jordan, it disappears from history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
Madaba must have been a town of some importance,
although the space enclosed within its
walls was barely a quarter of a mile square.
Père Séjourné, the Dominican archæologist, saw
gates on the north and east which have disappeared,
but indications remain of the existence
of four. The population was well provided
for as to water, for, in addition to two smaller
reservoirs, a pool at the S.W. angle measures
108 yards long, by 103 yards wide, and 13 feet
deep. It is now used as a field for the cultivation
of tobacco, for as long as it served its
original purpose it was the cause of constant
feuds with the Bedu. There was a street of
columns 150 yards in length. Bliss and Baedeker
mention five churches, the Père Curé told us
he had evidence of the existence of eight, for
which almost disproportionate number the
bishopric may account. The piety of to-day
takes another form. Schumacher, in a valuable
monograph (1895), relates that the former curé,
Pater Biever, describing his ten years' experience
among the people, related that the hardest
things to teach them had been not to bring
their sabres and other weapons into church
and not to greet him, if they chanced to arrive
while service was proceeding, with the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
respectful but loud-voiced, <i>Marhabā jā chūre!</i>—"May
thy path be broad, O priest!"</p>

<p>When he enunciated the teaching, "Love
your enemies, do good to those that hate you,"
an old shech called out: "Halt, priest! you
can preach that to the old women." In certain
respects the people of Madaba stand higher
than the Christians west of the Jordan, and
offences against morality are very rare—among
the genuine Bedu they are almost unknown.
Monogamy is the rule in Madaba, though in
Kerak, whence the people come, polygamy is
found even among Christians, and among others
is quite usual.</p>

<p>In matters of peace and warfare they observe
the rules of the Bedu, and Schumacher quotes
interesting examples of what he truly calls the
sound views of honour and manliness, to be
noticed even among the wild customs of these
children of nature.</p>

<p>Their absolute disregard of the beautiful, their
indifference to the abominations of their surroundings,
is almost incredible. Chickens and
goats defile the most exquisite mosaics; a
Corinthian capital, picked up by chance, is
inserted between an unhewn stone and a slab
of marble; a squalid hut has a carved lintel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
Père Séjourné points out that in a small church,
which Bliss describes as the most interesting
which he visited, an inscription reveals the age
of the building, and serves, so to speak, as a
<i>point de repère</i> for others. It recites that "the
mosaic work of this sanctuary and of the holy
house of the altogether pure Sovereign Mother
of God has been made by the care and the
zeal of this town of Madaba ... in the month
of February of the year 674, indication 5"—that
is, 362 of our present era. Another church,
portions of which have to be sought for in
several different dwellings, has been regarded
as the cathedral; it is 125 feet long, with aisles
twice the breadth of the nave, which is 29 feet,
all in Corinthian style.</p>

<p>But the <i>pièce de résistance</i> at Madaba, the goal
of the savant's pilgrimage, is the celebrated
mosaic—the Madaba map—which, discovered in
1884, was not known to the public till 1897.
We were armed with a letter from the Greek
patriarch desiring that the Professor and his
party might have every assistance in their investigations.
We accordingly made our way to
the Greek church at the foot of the rising
ground upon which the town is built. They
had not been aware of our coming, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
suggested that, in order that suitable preparations
might be made, we should return next
day, which was, unfortunately, impossible. By
the time that a solid mass of dust and dirt
had been laboriously removed (for the means
taken for the preservation of the mosaic, render
it accessible only in detached sections, each
covered by glass) the twilight was so far advanced
that we saw it very imperfectly, and
are glad therefore not to depend upon our own
impressions for a description. It is a map, in
fine mosaic, of Palestine, including a part of
Lower Egypt, much broken and injured at the
edges, and, obviously, reduced in extent. It
serves, at present, as part of the flooring of
the Greek church, but, on account of its value,
as possibly the oldest map of Palestine in existence,
it is, very properly, covered in with glass,
on a principle strongly resembling a cucumber
frame.</p>

<p>The colours, which are various, and arranged
with a view to science rather than to art, are
as fresh as the day they were laid, and the
mosaic is a combination of a map, a picture,
and a ground plan.</p>

<p>Père Cléopas, a Greek priest, who is spoken
of as the discoverer, although it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
locally known for thirteen years, thus describes
it: "The artist was not content to give simply
the names of the towns, but, moreover, with
careful pains, he shows the form, size, and plan
of any town of importance; and further how
many doors and gates it has, whether these lie
to east or west, what important buildings it
contains, what is their style, and what is the
old name of the town, as well as that in use;
where hills are found and where plains; where
rivers and brooks and forests; where springs
and where hot springs; where ponds and lakes;
where boats and ships; where palms and where
bananas; all these, in their natural colours, are
exactly indicated upon the map."</p>

<p>It is worth while to give some short account
of the Madaba map, not only because the
history is interesting in itself, but because it is
thoroughly typical of much which happens in
this country. The facts are taken from a
<i>Mémoire</i> presented by Mons. Clermont-Ganneau
to the French Academy, and subsequently
published in the <i>Recueil d'Archéologie Orientale</i>.</p>

<p>The discoverer of the mosaic was a Greek
monk, of whom the very name has been forgotten,
and who, in 1884, communicated the fact
to the Greek Patriarch, who took no notice whatever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
One feels little regret that this worthy
ecclesiastic was, later, exiled to Constantinople,
and succeeded by the patriarch Gerasimos, who,
in 1890, six years after the original discovery,
found the letter, and immediately sent off an
architect with orders that the mosaic should be
included in the church about to be erected at
Madaba. We have the testimony of four monks
that, at this time, the mosaic was almost complete,
but the intelligent workman destroyed
much of it in order to lay the foundations of the
church, sacristy, and out-buildings; broke up
part to insert a pilaster, and left much of the
bordering, with its decorations of biblical imagery,
outside. He then returned, with the assurance
that the mosaic was unimportant.</p>

<p>Another six years elapsed, and Father Cléopas,
librarian of the Greek patriarchate, who chanced
to be arranging a visit to Jericho, was prevailed
upon by Monsignor Gerasimos, who had never
lost interest in the reported discovery, to continue
his journey as far as Madaba, in order
to report upon it. He returned in January
1897, thirteen years after the original discovery,
bringing with him a sketch of the map, and
some notes. M. Arvanitaki, a professional
map-maker, was at once despatched to make a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
drawing. He was a Greek, a member of the
Astronomical Society of France, and an accomplished
linguist, a matter of great importance
when abbreviations and contractions had to be
correctly rendered. Before his work could be
finished the patriarch died, and the geometer,
not being new to the little ways of Jerusalem,
was about to abandon an undertaking which any
succeeding patriarch might possibly repudiate,
but was, fortunately, encouraged by the Franciscans,
who undertook to translate the MS. of
Père Cléopas into French, and to publish the
work of the artist in twelve sheets of half-a-metre
square. This was successfully accomplished by
means of Lumière's orthochromatic plates, and
was forwarded to the Academy of France on
the 16th of March. The story of the misfortunes
of the map was, however, not yet complete. The
Greek patriarchate claimed the original drawings,
and the negatives were broken on their way
to Paris. M. Clermont-Ganneau, however,
succeeded in reproducing them, and made them
the basis of a communication to the Institute,
and so of introducing the valuable "find" to
the archæological world.</p>

<p>Meantime, Père Vincent, of the Dominican
Order in Jerusalem, had made another drawing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
which was published in pamphlet form with a
monograph by his learned colleague, Père
Lagrange, collaborating with Père Cléopas himself.
A further record was made, also early in
March, by Père Germer Durand, of the Assumptionist
Order, who also laid a complete photograph
before the Academy of France, consisting of ten
sheets, taken from above, a light scaffolding
having been erected for the purpose, an experiment
pronounced in the <i>Mémoire</i> as having been
"carried out in the most satisfactory manner
possible." Within two months, therefore, of the
visit of Père Cléopas, the mosaic, neglected for
thirteen years, had been the subject of three
separate monographs. The representative of the
English Palestine Exploration Fund made a
visit to Madaba which was wholly unsuccessful,
but the German architect, Paul Palmer, of
Jerusalem, assisted by a couple of artists, succeeded
in triumphing over many difficulties,
political as well as mechanical, and has made a
reproduction of the map, of the original size and
colouring, which now hangs, by the desire of the
patriarch, in the Greek School at Jerusalem,
where it is accessible to all comers, an object of
permanent value to scholars and archæologists.</p>

<p>The discovery has naturally given rise to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
vast amount of discussion, and has involved much
reconsideration of earlier topographical conclusions.
We can never sufficiently regret all
that has been so gratuitously lost, although, in
Palestine, one necessarily becomes somewhat
hardened to losses of the kind. Trustworthy
witnesses who saw the map before the mutilation
recently inflicted concur in testifying that
it originally recorded the position of Ephesus,
Smyrna, and Constantinople, showing that it
must have included Asia Minor and the
Bosphorus.</p>

<p>And so we wrangle and regret; we take long
journeys to see this marvel of the science of at
least thirteen hundred years ago; we dispute who
shall be accounted the first to perceive its worth;
what nation first presented the facts to the world;
what bearing they have upon the learning of to-day;
and, meantime, the name of the discoverer, though
he may still be living, is never mentioned, and
no one thinks of the human soul that imagined,
the human hands that wrought—the nameless
Byzantine priest into whose labours we have
entered!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">There</span>
was so much of interest at Madaba,
that we did not succeed in accomplishing
the early start we had intended, and even after
we were in the saddle, and had picked our way,
not without difficulty, among the scattered stones,
the middens, the children and dogs and chickens
which occupy such open spaces as serve for paths,
a native, speaking excellent German, came out of
a house to suggest a visit to yet another mosaic
pavement. This, however, we reluctantly declined,
for, although we had a journey of but five
hours in view, the sun was already high, and we
had a bare plateau to traverse.</p>

<p>We soon left all traces of town life behind, and
in little more than an hour came upon a scene
which was, to many of us, a new delight: that
of many hundreds of wandering camels in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
native surroundings—we had almost said their
native element, so different are these creatures
from the suffering, melancholy, over-worked, evil-smelling,
grumbling brutes to which we are
accustomed in Jerusalem. A camel to be seen
to advantage requires the primeval spaces for
which he was originally designed. He should
stand clear against the horizon, however boundless;
the background of narrow streets, the human
brutality and noise, the mud beneath feet intended
for desert sands, are an injustice for which
we, and not they, are to blame. Bewildered,
tortured, over-driven, he acquires that air of
abject dejection which he shares with the London
cab-horse, that habit of futile remonstrance which
we learn to associate with him, to the entire
exclusion of that dignity—an undoubted part of
the freedom which is his birthright—that grace,
which is inseparable from the surroundings that
were his when the original type, never yet
adapted to human environment, was first devised.</p>

<p>Camels of all shades of brown and grey were
there; camels that had never had their coats
disfigured by clipping nor galled with burdens;
white camels, almost dazzling against the sapphire
sky, the golden plain, the purple hills; baby camels,
playful as kittens but with a puppy-like air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
solemnity, and more graceful than young colts,
because better proportioned as to legs. The
Bedu speak of the white camels as "blue,"
possibly for the same reason that an inhabitant
of the Hebrides, when on the sea in stormy
weather, will speak of his island by a fictitious
name or, after dark, will whistle to his dogs
rather than call them by name, for fear of attracting
the attention of the Evil One. Many
superstitions among Arabs are associated with
blue, as again, the Highlander associating them
with green, the colour of the fairies, will
avoid naming the hue of the grass, calling it
blue if adjective be necessary. The Arab puts
a blue bead on his horse, a blue necklace on
his child; his wife carries blue beads on her
market-basket, and one is often hung over the
door of the house, especially a new house. So
Caliban, in the Oriental story which Shakespeare
preserves for us in "The Tempest," speaks of
his mother Setebos, the witch, as "a blue-eyed
hag" (not "blear-eyed" into which certain commentators
have corrected the original); and in
a commentary upon an Arabic poem by Al
Chirnik, sister of Tarafah, belonging to the
early part of the seventh century, a seeress is
described as "Hy, the blue-eyed one, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
the notorious people of the time of ignorance"—<i>i.e.</i>
the period before the revelation of the
Moslem faith.</p>

<p>Here and there the vast plain was dotted
with the black temporary villages of the Bedu,
generally arranged in a circle or square, <i>dooah</i>,
around a central space upon which all the tents
open, although, with some instinct of sanitation,
the drapery was generally raised, both "but
and ben," as they say in Scotland. The population
seemed to be largely abroad, and every
half mile or so we came upon a little group,
more or less keeping an eye upon the herds,
visible for miles, even to the farthest horizon,
where they made long dados of themselves
against the cloudless sky. Almost due south
of us, each on its own hill, overlooking a Roman
road running north and south, are two important
ruins—Um Weleed (mother of children) and
Um el Kuseir. They are only about half-an-hour
apart, and we longed to make the short
détour necessary to visit them, but the Professor's
face was turned where duty called and
we did not venture to propose the expenditure
of time. Tristram describes these cities, and
others lying along the same route, and thinks
they may have been at least Maccabean, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
they are obviously much older than the
Saracenic khans and the Roman forts, which
are alike numerous in the district. He says
that in all he looked in vain for any traces of
Christian worship but that in each case there
were the ruins of a temple, always outside the
city, with the entrance to the east, and, wherever
the architecture could be determined, of
Doric origin; and he speculates as to whether
these High Places may have originally served
for Baal-worship. Another point which he
notes, and which we, later, had opportunities
of verifying, is the immense number of cisterns
and underground storehouses, still in use by
the Bedu for storage of grain and protection of
flocks. It is interesting to recall that one of
the commands given upon the Moabite stone,
which was found but a few hours' journey south
west, was "Make for yourselves every man a
cistern in his house." The present names of
these ruined towns, Um Weleed, Kirbet el-Herri,
Zebîb, Um er-Resâs, Um el-Kuseir, and others, are
all Arabic, and do not help us in identification, and
trace of any other name seldom remains. They
must, nevertheless, have been important; Um Weleed,
for example, measures half-a-mile in length
within the walls, and has suburbs in addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
Of Ziza, however, where we halted for a
short time about four hours after leaving
Madaba, we find a clear record in the Roman
<i>Notitia</i>, where the name occurs, unchanged by
a single letter, as an important military station,
"<i>Equites Dalmatici Illyriciani Ziza</i>". Here
we found traces of what must have been one
of the largest towns of Roman Arabia, the
most prominent feature being a great tank of
solid masonry, 420 by 330 feet, still larger than
that at Madaba, and, although the dry season
was far advanced, and the reservoir is much
reduced in available extent by debris, containing
still a good supply of water. Steps, so
wide and shallow as to be accessible even to
horses, lead down to the water; many of the
single stones are over six feet in length, and the
reservoir was fed by an ingenious contrivance
which, aided by two sets of strong sluice gates
and an embankment of earth and masonry,
formerly economised all the water which, in
the heavy winter rains, would come rushing
along the valley and down the hill side, upon
which the town was built. In various parts of
the valley there are embankments, to turn the
water from other gorges and depressions into
this central reservoir, which is also provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
with dams in the event of flood, floods being
frequent and dangerous in this country, where,
in the early rains, the water rushes in torrents
along the surface of the baked and hardened
earth. In the neighbourhood of such provision
for a large population one naturally looks for
buildings of importance. Tristram observes that
the tank, though of such infinite consequence
as is barely conceivable to those who do not
know the East, is not defended, pointing to a
period of security, when the Dalmatian cavalry
swept the surrounding plains and made their
headquarters here and, possibly, at Castal.
Against the horizon, on the crest of the ridge,
are two castles, which we were unable to visit
but which were described by Tristram: one a
solidly-built fort, apparently Saracenic, although
constructed of older materials, which, to judge
from the sculpture remaining upon them, may
have been the ruins of Byzantine churches, the
other, to the east, is, he tells us, in a much
more ruinous condition. The present remains
seem to be Roman, but show traces of use as a
mosque, and among the material are sculptured
stones, possibly Byzantine, according to some
Persian, as well as fragments of cufic inscriptions.
Eastward, again, is the Roman town of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
Ziza, which includes a strange aggregation
such as is found in no country other than
Syria. There is a fine Saracenic building, said
by the Arabs to have been perfect until the
Egyptian invasion of 1832; there are cufic
inscriptions and sculptured crosses; an olive
mill of basalt; remains of sarcophagi; and a
large Christian church, of which one apse still
remains standing. All these ruins suffered considerably
from the wanton destruction wrought
by the Egyptian troops, who, it is said, threw
down a very perfect building in the town, and
several entire Christian churches. Tristram
was the first European to visit Mshatta and
Castal as well as Ziza; the last, at the suggestion
of Zadam, the son of the great shech of the
Beni Sakr, the local tribe of Bedu, who, by
the intervention of Klein, the German missionary
famous for the discovery of the Moabite
stone, accompanied Tristram as companion,
and protector of the expedition. The ruins
appear to have been previously pointed out
to Captain, now Sir Charles, Warren, the representative
of the Palestine Exploration Fund,
who, however, made no investigation, so that
it fell to the share of Tristram to be the
discoverer of Mshatta, one of the most remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
architectural monuments in the
world.</p>

<p>It was with ever-increasing eagerness of
expectation that we hastened on, after asking
our way from some railway workmen—Europeans—who
were living in tents among the ruins, and
who spoke a polyglot of Arabic, French, and
Italian. Within a few minutes we crossed the
line upon which they were engaged, intended—strange
anachronism!—to connect Damascus
with Mecca, an undertaking for which the
Turkish Government deserves the credit of
immense perseverance under very difficult conditions.
It may be mentioned, in passing, as
also to their credit, that they are now rapidly
carrying out the line from Haifa northwards,
undertaken some years ago by the English, and
which—after the whole district had been surveyed,
the line planned by the skill of Dr
Schumacher, the German-American Vice-Consul
at Haifa, and the work, in the hands of
an English engineer and English foreman,
had made some progress—was mysteriously
abandoned, to the serious loss of many of the
employés.</p>

<p>It is of this railway that Professor George
Adam Smith prognosticated so hopefully, as being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
the most important material innovation from
the West. "... Not only will it open up the
most fertile parts of the country, and bring back
European civilisation to where it once was
supreme—on the east of Jordan—but, if ever
European arms return to the country—as in a
contest for Egypt or for the Holy Places when
may they not return?—this railway, running
from the coast across the central battlefield of
Palestine, will be of immense strategic value"
("Hist. Geog. of the Holy Land," p. 20).</p>

<p>At the point where we cross the line the rails
are not yet in place, but the iron monster will
soon be here—fit symbol of an age which mocks
the time that is, but creates few monuments
which shall defy the time that shall be; which
enables the curious to gaze at the wonders of
the past, but leaves him no leisure to initiate
what may survive our race, and speak, as do
the ruins of Moab, to an age and a people of a
distant future. We come on the wings of steam,
and with all the miracles of science, but we
leave no trace but unsightly heaps and a scar
upon the face of the landscape. We were glad,
some of us, when we had reached and crossed the
unshamed anachronism, and, forgetting the noise
that would break the silence of the plain, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
smoke that would soil its purity, the advertisement,
the competition, with their attendant
vulgarity and vice, we could throw ourselves
again into the arms of Nature, and listen to the
voices of our Mother Earth.</p>

<p>It seemed far more in keeping with our mood
of the moment when, an hour or so later, we
crossed the <i>Haj</i> (pilgrim) Road from Damascus
to Mecca; the road, or rather aggregation of
paths, some hundreds of parallel tracks, dispersed
over a width of 1000 yards, alternately dividing
and amalgamating, over which, for some twelve
hundred years, the followers of the Prophet have
passed to the visible centre and cradle of their
faith. It is possible that the sons of Isaac may
have trodden this very path on their way from
the desert to the land of promise, for here there
can be little variation in roadways, as they are
determined not by mountain passes or choice of
gradient, but by the presence of water. The
shech of the district is responsible for the safe
conduct of the pilgrimage across his territory,
and it is at their own risk that any wander from
the caravan. It is not many years since a body
of pilgrims, tempted by some vision of a nearer
route, had to be followed up when they did not
reappear. A few only were saved, but two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
hundred perished from thirst, and one shudders
to think of the possible animal suffering involved,
although, happily, most would be mounted on
the long-enduring camel. The Professor told us
that at times, when his caravan had lost its way
in the desert at night, his mukaris would stoop
down and scoop up a handful of sand some two
or three inches deep, which they would smell for
traces of camel droppings, showing, when they
were deeper than a possible surface accident,
that the travellers were on the timeworn track.</p>

<p>Almost involuntarily we drew rein, and
paused, with mingled feelings, before this record
of human emotions. Five times a day every
good Moslem must turn toward Mecca, and once
in a lifetime, if possible, he must journey thither
in pilgrimage, either personally or by proxy.
The road is strewn with the bones not only of
animals but of men, who have fallen by the way,
from thirst or exhaustion, it may be, or from
plague and the cholera, which so constantly
dog their footsteps. The Arabs have a story
that a good Derwish in Mecca begged the
leader of the pilgrimage to take the cholera
away with him from a place where so many
holy men were daily perishing. "But," said the
Haj, "there are many good men in Jerusalem,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
whom we can ill spare!" "Well," said the
Derwish, "take it, anyway, and if Allah does
not want it in Jerusalem He will send it on
elsewhere"; and that, says history, as well as
tradition, has happened annually ever since, for
though Jerusalem is left untouched, the dread
cholera accompanies the returning pilgrims
almost every season, and is seldom far away
from the track which lay before us.</p>

<p>Although many now avail themselves of the
steamers on the Red Sea and Persian Gulf,
thousands assemble every year at Damascus,
where the holy tent of the caravan is kept, and
large numbers still come, even from Circassia,
Central Asia, and Northern Africa, in order to
make the orthodox journey in its entirety.
Formerly it was reckoned as lasting twenty-seven
days but, owing to various mitigations in
the difficulty of travel, the time tends, every
year, to become shorter. Nevertheless, the
Arabs have a saying which expresses a journey
of indefinite length (much as we say "to go to
Jericho"): "To go to the gate of God"; (Bab-el
Allah) the gate that is, at the end of the
Meidân, the suburb of Damascus, where the
pilgrimage assembles, known as Bawâbet Allâh.</p>

<p>Though, in these days when, even among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
Moslems, the tendency shows itself to minimise
the duties of life, and many only contribute to
the cost of the general pilgrimage, and compromise
with conscience by a mere payment
in money, nevertheless, even yet, custom, superstition,
temporary advantage, hereditary conventionality
or, it may be, pious instinct, religious
fervour, cosmic yearning, avail now, as in all
ages, to the direction of human conduct, and
the parallel tracks are still well trodden. To
us, who can enter in part only into the spirit
of the East—its absolute faith in predestination,
in the predetermination of salvation or perdition,
in the irrelevance between religion and
conduct, in the resignation which seems to us
so utterly without hope, in its limitation of the
relations between Man and God, its perpetual
ascription of praise with but little margin for
intercession—the whole position is a great
mystery, and in the tramp, tramp of thousands
of feet, which seems to us to echo wearily through
vast avenues of time, we find it difficult to catch
any note of love, or hope, or aspiration. They
carry an inevitable burden of human sorrow, which
is no fit offering at such a shrine as theirs; they
have hopes and fears and human longings
which they may confide to none but human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
hearts: God is great; there is no god but God;
all that befalls them is already decreed; and
the pilgrimage is to His glory and in no sense
for their own consolation. Browning's <i>Epistle
of an Arab Physician</i> recurred to the mind of
some among us, with the startled utterance of
the Syrian contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote">"... think, Abib; dost thou think?"</div>
<div class="verse">So, the All-great were the All-loving too!</div>
<div class="verse">So through the thunder comes a human voice</div>
<div class="verse">Saying: "O heart I made, a <i>heart</i> beats here!"</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus dreaming, we journeyed on, still over
vast spaces with dim horizons, bounded by low
ranges of hills, showing in deep purple against
the cloudless, sapphire sky.</p>

<p>Suddenly all was changed! We were no
longer among the unsatisfied yearnings of pilgrimage
but the companions of that youngest
brother in the fairy tales, whose long journeyings
had so often entered into our dream of the distant
lands, for were we not drawing up at the gate
of the Enchanted Palace, more beautiful than
any dream, more deeply mysterious than the
wonders of the Arabian Nights?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
Truly the place was under a spell—here in
this wide wilderness, an unfinished dream of
the sculptor of a giant age, stood the Castle of
Mshatta; far exceeding any description which
we had read or heard; paralysing us with such
awe of its beauty and mystery as seldom seizes
one before the work of Man; its immensity,
its majesty, the unique perfection of its workmanship,
above all, its silence, its absolute
mystery, seeming in unison with the vast works
of Nature all around, rather than with any conception
of a merely human mind.</p>

<p>We were speechless in presence of this
monument of a race to which we could give no
name, of a purpose at which we could not even
guess, of aspirations never fulfilled, hopes never
realised.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tristram, after his second visit in the year
1872, returned to England, declaring that the
whole question continued to be an insoluble
mystery. Even the name gave no clue, and
such meaning as it may even have had as <i>Um
shita</i>, "mother of winter," presumably so called as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
affording winter shelter for the flocks, is now
subtracted, for although the spelling of Mashita or
Meshita has been employed up to the present,
even by the precise Baedeker in his English
edition of 1900, the derivation is now declared
fanciful, and <i>Mshatta</i> the more accurate rendering
of the name.</p>

<p>That the problem is a difficult one is the more
obvious from the very fact that it has none of
the complications which beset the archæologist
elsewhere. There have been no subtractions, no
accretions, no changes. Hardly a ruin remains
in Syria where Moslem zeal has not destroyed
its sculptured imagery. Here all is perfect as
when the artist laid down his chisel. Not a
detail is defaced; the few stones which may have
been removed have in no degree marred its
completeness; its position has been its protection;
far alike from the ignorant zeal of the
fellahin Moslem, from the misdirected industry
of the town Christian, it has inherited none of
the blessings of civilisation. It is still the
"unravished bride of quietness." As Tristram
has well said: "Too proud to cultivate, happily
too careless to destroy, the incurious Bedawin
has roamed over its rich pasture lands: never
tempted to loosen a stone, for he needs no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
building materials, and content if the old cisterns
and arches afford a shelter in winter for his flocks."</p>

<p>In the wonderful façade upwards of fifty animals,
exquisitely sculptured, in every variety of attitude,
still quench their thirst in pairs, bending opposite
each other, over a graceful vase; their outline,
their very motion perfectly rendered; lions, lynxes,
panthers, gazelle, buffaloes; here is a man with
a dog, there a man carries a basket of fruit; birds
hover; peacocks, storks, partridges, parrots, vaunt
their beauty, with the grace of the models from
which they were drawn, in days when we were
living in wattled huts. The more conventional
outlines—the cornices and mouldings, the continuous
vandyke, with a great rose boss at every
angle—although strikingly unfamiliar, are eminently
satisfying to the eye, and the wonderful
realism of the flowers, grapes, and vine-leaves,
which fill up every remaining inch of the façade,
is like a dream of Grinling Gibbon carved out
in massive stone.</p>

<p>Where, unless in the Alhambra, or (as we learn
from Fergusson, De Vogüe, Dieulafoy, and other
authorities on Persian art) in remote parts of
Persia, can we find anything in the least comparable
to the bewildering richness of the designs
which have blossomed for us here in the wilderness?—far,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
not only from mankind, but from such
gifts of nature as would make possible the presence
of mankind; where, for lack of water, even the
rich soil of the great tableland cannot be cultivated,
and the district must for ever remain,
as it has ever been, a desert! The Arabs have
no traditions of this place, as they have of so
many other ruins, and they do not even ascribe
its foundation to Saladdin or the Khalifs, to
whom all that is great is almost invariably
assigned. Can a building covered with human
and animal designs owe its origin to the Moslem,
to whom all such representations were forbidden?
Although Thompson, the author of "The Land
and the Book," proposed to consider the ruins as
those of a church and convent, there is, apart
from all other difficulties as to size, plan, and
position, no single indication of Christian workmanship
or symbol. Were the Romans likely
to build a sumptuous Oriental palace in a lonely
desert, far from any military road? If the
Bedawy, the wandering Ishmaelite, sole denizen
of deserts such as this, were for once to depart
from his normal style of architecture—two or
three poles and a piece of cloth—is it likely that
his descendants would have preserved no tradition
of so extraordinary a deviation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
One solution offered is, nevertheless, that it
was the work of Byzantine architects, employed
by the desert tribes, notably the Beni Sakr,
in the days when they were rich with the subsidies
paid to them by the Romans for protection
of their colonies and forts and roads from the
encroachments of other enemies of the desert;
that it was never intended as a place of residence
but merely for the reception of ambassadors,
who were to be over-awed, partly by the miracle
of this rose of the wilderness, partly by the skill
shown in the triumph over niggard Nature; or, in
the event of this being insufficient, were to be
separated from their steeds, and presented with
free house room until hunger, thirst, and loneliness
should make them amenable. Whether the work
remained incomplete from paucity of money or
of ambassadors, is not revealed.</p>

<p>Another solution, of which Fergusson is the
originator, is that it was the work of the Persian
king, Chosroes II., who, between the years 611 and
614, overran the whole of Northern Syria and Asia
Minor. Gibbon's enumeration, gathered from contemporary
authors (Gibbon's "Decline and Fall,"
Chap. x. 701), of his 20,000 camels and 3000
concubines, his 960 elephants and 6000 horses,
suggests, at least, that he had the money for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
building of artistic palaces, and the fact that
he spent the years of his youth at Hierapolis,
where he had ample opportunity for studying
the art and culture of Asia Minor, may suggest,
further, that he possibly had the taste. These
kings of the Sassanian dynasty were, indeed,
noted for their love of architecture, and the
Court favourite of Chosroes II., Ferhad, was an
architect. A drawing of an ancient bas-relief
at Shiraz, to be seen at the Institute of British
Architects, presents Chosroes as slaying a lion,
while his fair favourite, Shireen, watches Ferhad
sculpturing birds and foliage upon a rock. Some
forty or fifty Sassanian bas-reliefs, sculptured
pictures such as those at Mshatta, still remain
in various places. Moreover, we learn that
Chosroes II. had thousands of Greek and
Syrian slaves, whom he employed in the construction
of sumptuous buildings. The site of
Mshatta might well lie in his route between
Damascus and the Nile. (<i>See</i> Chap. iii. p. 53.)</p>

<p>The sudden arrest of the work—one stone
west of the entrance gate has been just laid down
beside the place prepared for it, many stones
have the sculpture incomplete, or merely indicated,
we saw slabs upon which tentative sketches of
horses had been made—might be accounted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
by the fact that, in 623, the Emperor Heraclius,
"the Roman eagle swooping magnificently in her
dying throes," compelled Chosroes, after only,
at the utmost, fourteen years of power in Syria,
to recall his troops from Egypt, Syria, and Asia
Minor, and though, for four years, the strife was
fierce between Persian and Roman, the latter
ultimately triumphed, and Chosroes died miserably
in a dungeon. Barely ten years later the
Romans were banished by the Saracens.</p>

<p>The learned Professor Brünnow has made the
suggestion that this building originated with the
Ghassanides, the Beni Jafn, who migrated from
Yemen in the first Christian century and, having
been made, by the Romans, wardens of the marches
of the Empire, developed later into an important
dynasty; submitting even to the civilising influences
of Christianity, for, in 180, Amir I. founded
a monastery in Haurân. Brünnow observed the
same vandyke pattern, which, however, is in itself
a somewhat elementary design, upon a water
jar in Jaulan, a district considerably north of
Mshatta, but where, he observes, the Ghassanides
were at home. Although the jar was modern
it was conceivably copied from an ancient design,
as was, undoubtedly, another standing beside it.
Moreover, he found a pattern of double vandykes—that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
is, of squares joined at the corners, upon a
frieze in the same district. Other archæologists
object that certain details cannot be older than
Justinian, when Arabian kings held no sway near
the Jordan, others doubt whether the Arabian
kings ever extended their power into this
unquestionably Roman province. To the mere
layman it seems so probable that a row of
vandykes was the first thing that Adam drew
with a stick upon the sand, that he fails to find
in it anything distinctive enough to form the
basis of a historical or architectural theory.</p>

<p>The entrance, with its magnificent façade, is
to the south, the sculpture, extending over 156
feet in the centre of the face, is broken by a
gateway, and rises to the height of 18 feet.
Behind this is a quadrangle, 170 yards square,
at each angle a round bastion, and five others,
semicircular, between them. On the south
front alone there are six, the central gateway
being flanked by two, boldly octagonal, and
magnificently sculptured. The interior is best
described as being divided into three portions,
by parallel lines running north and south, the
side ones about 46, the centre about 66, yards
in width. The centre one has been divided into
three sections; that nearest the gate, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
portioned into many chambers, was probably
intended for a guard house; the second may
have been an open space, with a fountain, and
the third or northernmost was the palace itself.
This consists of brick walls, resting on three
courses of stone, the bricks, of somewhat curious
form, resembling, it is said, those of no known
building, except a ruined palace north-east of
Damascus, described by Tyrwhitt Drake and
Sir Richard Burton. They are like Roman
tiles, but larger and thinner, 3 inches thick and
about 18 inches square. The palace is divided
into twenty-four rooms, the entrance hall being
about 50 feet square, four others being perhaps
two-thirds of that size. The entrance is through
a wide doorway, with massive pilasters and
elaborate capitals, with ornamentation, possibly,
of Persian or Egyptian—certainly not of Greek—design.
Architects have perplexed themselves
over the problem, still unsolved, as to how the
palace was lighted, as there is not a single
window from without, and within only a few
small round openings over the doors. Bliss, of
Beirut, the distinguished American archæologist,
conjectures that the large halls were unroofed,
and that the smaller rooms opened upon them,
a plan quite consistent with the Oriental conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
of a house, originally derived from tents
opening into a central space, and developing,
first into rooms opening into a court, and,
later, into the modern house, in which all
rooms on both floors open into a leewan, or
central apartment.</p>

<p>Naturally, all these observations were made
later, for it was our privilege to remain for
some nights within the palace walls, where,
amid kind and hospitable friends, and in comfortable
tents, bearing the familiar initials
T. I. W. (Thames Iron Works), relics of the
abandoned English railway, we found leisure
to rest and to dream. Some of us found the
spell of fairyland so strong that little else than
dream seemed possible. Never, perhaps, so
loud as here, did we "hear the East a-calling,"</p>

gone from among us, so far removed we seemed

ready</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Towards evening, when the golden light was
fading from over the wide plain, we turned our
steps towards the eastern hills, a long, low, limestone
range, a day's ride distant, although, in
the clear atmosphere, it seemed as if we might
almost reach their foot in time to see the sun
set. One of the soldiers in charge of our party
kept us in sight all the time; for away in those
dim recesses are wild tribes, who submit to no
government but that of their own chief, Ibn
Rashid, the great Arabian potentate, whose
stronghold is far away beyond the hills, in the
city of Hayil, and whom all other shechs hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
in awe. Our host, Dr Schumacher, told us that
not even his Circassian soldiers, fierce and fearless
as they are, would consent to accompany him
beyond that plain into the district of Hadramat,
and it was still with the sensation of being in
touch with fairy lore that we listened while the
Professor told us stories of his sojourn in that
distant land, of hospitality received in that far-away
stronghold, and of personal and friendly
intercourse with the great chief himself. We
were interested later to note the anachronism of
the two cairns, on widely distant hills, remains
of Dr Schumacher's survey for the great German
map of East Jordan.</p>

<p>As our shadows lengthened we stood to watch
the herds of gazelle descending into the plain;
the graceful creatures, secure in their swiftness,
coming so near that we could watch their movements
even without our field-glasses. We had
already learnt that they came down daily, towards
sunset, often close to the palace walls, and our
Sportsmen had long lain in wait for them there
in the hope of game, but the news of the human
invasion, the profane breaking of the silence,
had gone forth, and the gentle creatures, having
little reason to feel confidence in the lords of
creation, had turned away elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
As we retraced our steps we lingered, picking
up here a flint arrow-head, gift of a distant past,
there a bleached snake-skin, perfect as though
worn but yesterday. Other treasures, too, we
found: wonderful velvety arums, crimson, purple,
and black, not the large <i>arum palæstinum</i> of the
spring, but a minute, dainty, fairy-like copy of
it, fitly adorning this dream world; crocuses,
leafless, almost stalkless, white, mauve, and pink,
rich relations of the "naked ladies" of our home
meadows, and tiny pink geraniums, the lingering
guests of summer.</p>

<p>Scarcely were we again at home, when Nature
endowed us with another, and truly royal,
spectacle. As the full moon rose, above our
palace walls, she was eclipsed, and we stood
long, watching alternately the western miracle
of sunset and the eastern pageant of the slow
and, as it seemed, reluctant moonrise. Some
of the Arab servants watched with us, but they
were of so superior a class that they showed
but the faint, unimaginative interest of average
civilised man elsewhere. They told us, however,
of the superstitious practices still pursued by
those "who knew no better"—the singing and
beating of tom-toms and sacrifice of a cock.
They were wonderful servants, or seemed so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
to us, the slaves of the kitchen of the West.
The cook produced excellent dinners, of three
hot courses, upon a box of charcoal embers
he could lift with one hand, and the waiters,
summoned with a hand-clap, not only brought
but <i>ran</i> to bring whatever you might want.
Everything was spotlessly clean, and the waiting
at table would have done credit to an English
"Jeames." They all spoke at least three
languages, and they amused our leisure moments
with games and songs. The native, however,
must come out somewhere, and we are bound
to record that, when an imprisoned cock crowed
from a small wooden box, these Arabs, who are
never quiet one second themselves, took him
out and whipped him!</p>

<p>We went to rest early in our luxurious tents,
and woke next morning to find, among other
miracles, that the water in our jugs was barely
above freezing point.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span>
was with something like the pain of a personal
parting that we bade farewell to Mshatta.
Our friends, too, were breaking up camp this 7th
of October, and as the German flags were saluted
before being taken down, we realised to the full,
as sometimes happens, that here was one of
those moments in life which could never recur;
that our joy in the marvellous beauty of the
spot, in the indefinable fusion of Art and Nature,
was such as we could never repeat. The
swallows, who had made their home in the
ruined palace, would soon dart and skim in consciousness
of sole possession; the lizards, when
the sun became hot, would bask upon the
wall as they had basked a thousand years; the
gazelles would wander fearlessly around at sunset,
all would be as before, except where man
had left his <i>imprimatur</i>, the scar of death and destruction
that follows his tracks across the face of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
Nature. The very dogs had gone already: the
foolish puppy, with its woolly coat, the beautiful
tawny deerhound, more light limbed, more fleet
than ours, in proportion as the gazelle, his prey,
exceeds our moorland deer in swiftness and in
grace. The dream was past, "so sleeping, so
aroused from sleep," we were on one of those
tablelands of life from which no change was
possible but descent to the commonplace of
every day. We had seen the pale moonlight
on the palace walls, the purple hills we might
never hope to cross; we had had visions of
an enchanted world we might never see; we had
had glimpses of a page we might never hope
to turn.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>We were bound for Ammân, not more than
between five and six hours' ride away, and our
horses, refreshed by their rest, went gaily along
the gently undulating plain. Somewhat north
we came in sight of Castal, a Roman fortress,
on a hill westward, which some of the party—the
Sportsmen, and the Doctor—had visited
yesterday, and which Tristram, its discoverer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
considered different in character, as well as
superior in size, to the usual castle of lookout
and defence to be found all over districts where
Roman colonies and roads may have needed
protection and supervision. Although the place
is not mentioned in Eusebius, either in the
<i>Itineraries</i> or the <i>Notitia</i>, its name is obviously
Roman, and its size, for it is capable of accommodating
some twelve hundred cavalry, speaks
for its importance. It contains many fragments
of fine white marble, not indigenous. There
appear to have been two castles: the main
building, on the crest of the hill, 84 yards square,
of which only the lower storey remains, and a
smaller building, northward, of superior workmanship,
with a balustrade of fluted Corinthian squared
pilasters. The ancient city, which includes remains
which may be Greek, stands N.W. of
the castle. During the last five years it has been
occupied by Bedu, very greatly to its injury.</p>

<p>We had exchanged our escort, as the officer
granted by the Pasha for our safe conduct was
not responsible for us after we had reached
Madaba. We had, accordingly, bidden him farewell
before leaving, and had been touched by
the fact that he had positively declined to receive
a present, alleging that to do so would detract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
from the honour which he had enjoyed in being
permitted to accompany so distinguished a person
as the Professor. The member of our party who
best knew the country, cynically observed that
he must have seen more profit in refusal than
in acceptance! He had a good voice, and,
though Arab music is certainly an acquired
taste, had given us pleasure, and contributed
variety to the <i>al-fresco</i> concerts we occasionally
enjoyed. Among other songs had been one
composed by a certain poet Nimr, whose grave
we were to visit later. Silence is impossible
to an Arab, and when they are not talking they
sing. Our mukaris also sang, the words often
being improvised out of some passing circumstance,
and with nonsense rhymes.</p>

<p>Whether the following was the actual air or
only another exactly like it, it would be impossible
to say. For this we are indebted to Dr
Schumacher, who found it among the 'Anazeh
tribe of Bedu, said to be especially fond of both
music and poetry, and who relates that, "walking
in the caravan of camels, his mantle or
sheepskin thrown over one shoulder and an old
musket or a huge stick carried on the other,
the Bedawin is heard continually chanting the
following monotonous song":—</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></div>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 450px;">
  <img src="images/score.jpg" width="450" height="157" alt="score"/>
  <div class="caption">
    <p>Ya yab a ah yeh | ya hala aleh<br />
       Ya yab a ah yeh | âh ya ha lâ leh | oooh!</p>
    <p class="hide"><a href="music/syrian.mid">[Listen]</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the Arab sings he shuts his mouth, and,
very literally, "sings through his nose," four notes,
or rather tones, amply sufficing for a melody.
When we sang they seemed vastly amused, and
our younger mukari was caught more than once
mimicking our gestures, beating time, and opening
his mouth; while the other was in fits of
laughter.</p>

<p>The successor of our officer was a Circassian,
and, though equally picturesque, of quite a
different type. In place of the flowing robe
and floating keffeeye of the Bedu he wore an
astrachan cap, close-fitting coat, leggings tucked
inside low shoes with heels, and the military
cloak of the Turkish cavalry. His horse was
very powerful, and always well groomed, and,
what is more unusual in the Turkish army as
represented in Syria, his accoutrements and
harness—silver-mounted, with enamel decoration—were
bright and well kept. He had all the
apparent moroseness characteristic of his race,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
and never spoke except under pressure; but the
Lady reported that he was kindly in rendering
small services unasked, would always ride up
to her if she became accidentally separated from
the party, especially if she were any distance
in advance, and was expert in mounting and
dismounting her, although never obtruding his
assistance.</p>

<p>About half-an-hour from Mshatta the Sportsmen
sighted a herd of gazelle, and, still sore from
previous disappointments, dismounted to stalk
them—as usual, in vain. They vanished like
smoke round the base of a low hill, which one
of the party climbed, in search rather of information
as to their habits, than in hope of a kill.
He came back with the report that even a gunshot
had failed to break up their ranks, and that
they went on their way in perfect order.</p>

<p>The road, still over a wide plain, with occasional
undulations, might have been considered
barren of interest by those who could not find
delight in the wonderful gradations of colouring,
dun against the cloudless sky; the sensation of
infinite space; the crocuses and minute arums,
dainty jewels set in golden sands; the darting
lizards, distinguishable only in motion from their
surroundings; the tiny white shells of the land-snails;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
the scent of the wormwood <i>artemisium</i>
when crushed beneath our horses' feet; the
myriads of larks, including the exquisite crested
lark—the Mary-lark of the Highlands of Scotland;
while now and then a deep purple shadow crossing
our path told of a griffon-vulture or lanner-falcon
swooping over the plain, to the terror of
bird and beast.</p>

<p>From time to time the Professor would break
out into song, not the irritating snatches which
are an insult alike to silence and to conversation,
but a consistent and complete rendering, as
careful as if in any drawing-room, of some
quaint old folk-song picked up in his many
wanderings—and which, sung with an artistic
verve in a mellow tenor, others uniting in bass
or alto in a harmonised refrain, filled the air
with a melody not unworthy of the surrounding
silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly we were startled by a sound so
unwonted, yet so strangely familiar, that we
could hardly believe in its reality—the shriek
of the railway whistle! We were again nearing
the Haj railway, at a point where it is actually
in use, for 300 kilometres, out of the 2000 projected,
are already complete. A little farther
and we came across quite a village of the tents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
of the workmen, the engineers and foremen
being mainly German. The Turkish flag was
floating, and Turkish soldiers were in charge,
for the protection of the undertaking, which
seems to be regarded by the Bedu rather with
a sad apprehension than with active opposition.
Dr Schumacher relates that, when surveying for
the English upon the line afterwards abandoned,
he discussed the matter with the friendly shech
of the 'Anazeh—a superior tribe, said to number
300,000—who is the official protector of the Haj
road. Shech Muhammed realised that the
presence of the iron monster must rob him of
much grazing ground; but he resigned himself,
in Moslem fashion, to the inevitable.</p>

<p>"I see well that with the great iron road
we cannot remain long in Haurân; but we know
that this country is not for ever to be ours, for
we have heard how the descendants of those
whose bones lie under the ruins of this land
are to come back, and rebuild once more its
cities, even as they were in the times of their
forefathers"; adding, after a pause: "But we
will retire to the 'Ajlûn [the district farther
north], where there is place yet enough for our
tribe. <i>Allah yebârik!</i>" ("May Allah's blessing
be upon it!"). The Bedu hold the tradition that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
the <i>frenjy</i> (Franks) originally possessed the
country, and will one day return; that all over
the land are indications, marked upon stones,
of treasure to be recovered; and that the visits
of archæologists are for the purpose of so
changing these marks as to confuse the Arabs,
who are beginning to understand them too; for
have they not their museums in Constantinople
and Jerusalem, and are they not making investigations
and excavations of their own?</p>

<p>We crossed the railway, a point where it had
reached 200 kilometres south of Damascus, and
very soon afterwards began to feel that we
were once more in the world of man, however
remote may have been the date of his occupation.
Caves and grottoes in the hillside showed
traces of adaptation to his needs; hewn stones
lay about in piles; what looked like the remains
of a cenotaph attracted our attention; and we
dismounted to examine a group of sarcophagi—some
but lately exposed to view, others which
had long lain upon the surface. Most had a
resting-place for the head and a groove for
the lid.</p>

<p>A sudden turning at the ford of a rapid stream
revealed the town of Ammân, lying in a narrow
valley between low but precipitous hills. Most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
of us were utterly unprepared, after six hours
of riding across a lonely tableland, to find an
orderly town of 10,000 inhabitants, of an aspect
so superior to anything we had seen since
leaving Jerusalem, or even, so far as the actual
town is concerned, to Jerusalem itself, that an
explanation seemed necessary, and the statement
that the population was Circassian was, geographically,
an added perplexity. The houses,
built partly of mud brick and partly of ancient
material like those of Madaba, were well placed,
most had porticos and balconies, and some were
enclosed with well-swept yards. It was not
immediately that we realised to the full the
causes of a certain sense of unfamiliarity, of
having passed into another country, with other
conditions. The ear was, perhaps, the first
sense conscious of change. The town was <i>silent</i>.
There was none of the shrieking, none of the
high-pitched voices, none of the singing of an
Arab entourage—not only because we were
among Circassians, but also because we were
in a place where not a woman, not even a young
girl, was to be seen! There were men in plenty,
silently stalking about, like shabby ghosts of the
Prince Regent, in tight-waisted coats, high vests,
a display of silver buttons and braid, full skirts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
and high boots. Instead of the dangling sword
proper to the rest of their historic effect, all
carried a revolver at the side, as well as a long
dagger upright in the girdle. All were armed,
and a row of cartridges across the breast was
as much <i>de rigueur</i> as the low astrachan cap
which completed the costume. There were no
cafés; no dice-boards at street corners; no
lounging, screaming, idling; no "making kafe"—the
Arabic phrase for doing nothing, in company
with others similarly employed, and a row
of water-pipes.</p>

<p>These Circassians have an interesting history.
In spite of all that is said of "the unspeakable
Turk," perhaps few rulers have so many varieties
of voluntary immigrants within their domains.
The Circassians of East Jordanland seem to
have first left their home in the Caucasus, Kamnimotsk,
or Kakupschi, about the year 1860,
and to have wandered in search of a home where
they might be privileged to live under Moslem
rule. Their leader, the Emir Nūh Bey, a major
in the Russian army, conducted them first into
Asia Minor, and finally, after many difficulties
and disappointments, about 1878, to this district,
which they call "the edge of the desert"—possibly
with some personal intention on the part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
of their leader, who, as his son, 'Abd el hamīd
Bey, informed Dr Schumacher, was descended
from a family named Hûsh or Hûshi, who came
originally from Ramleh (by some identified with
Arimathea) in the plain of Sharon, and fought
against the Crusaders. Their crest, which they
bear upon their weapons, and which, in the
Caucasus, they branded upon their cattle, was
a mace. The same, with the addition of the
letters <i>alef</i> within the head of the mace, was
also branded upon their slaves. These Hûshi
travelled from Jerusalem into Anatolia, and
thence into the Caucasus, and now, as it would
seem, were, after the lapse of centuries, on the
way back to the cradle of their race. They
arrived in the Jaulân, the district which, with
the Belka, they have since colonised, about 1880,
and in less than a quarter of a century have
changed the face of the district which they
inhabit. They are frugal and industrious, and
have some knowledge of agriculture. Unfortunately,
their industry has, in one respect, been
misdirected, and they are the acknowledged
purveyors of tree trunks for roofing and other
architectural purposes, which they convey all
over the district in two-wheeled carts drawn by
a team of oxen. As the wheels are guiltless of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
grease, as roads, as we understand them, are
practically unknown, and the loads heavy, the
approach of these vehicles is known half-a-mile
in advance. The melancholy result of their
timber trade is that the surrounding hillsides
have, within the last twenty years, been almost
denuded of their oaks and pines. It is some
slight mitigation, however, that the Circassians
plant as well as destroy, and promising fruit
gardens follow the banks of the stream, especially
at Jerash, but also at Ammân and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In many respects they are very different from
the Arabs: in their industry, their settled homes,
their power of initiation, their habits. They
have superior agricultural instruments; they do
not look upon the camel and the ass as the sole
possible means of transportation; but, alone in
Syria, until the recent establishment of Jewish
and German colonies, employ carts, those for
lighter purposes being made of wattles. They
preserve their national dress, and neither the
tarbush of the Arab of the towns, nor the aba
or mantle, common to all, have ever been
adopted. Many speak Turkish fluently, the
elder ones some Russian, most a little Arabic
with a bad accent, but their ordinary tongue
continues to be Circassian. The Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
Government has permitted them to repopulate
various ruinous towns—Nawa, Ammân, Jerash,
and various villages—for a given period, without
paying any taxes, and, in spite of certain incidents
of attack and reprisal between themselves and
the Bedu, fierce enough for the time, they have
succeeded in inspiring their neighbours with
respect or, perhaps, awe. They themselves, it
is said, are perfectly fearless in attack or defence,
and extremely severe in exaction of vengeance.
Whereas the fellahin fear to attract attention by
successful crops of fruit or grain, lest they should
be called upon to feed the Bedu and the tax-gatherer,
the Circassians fear no one, and at
present pay no taxes. Hence, as well as from
superior capacity and industry, they effect, as
no fellah may venture to do, improvements of
a kind which are permanent; they make walls
and roads, they devise systems of irrigation,
they plant hedges and trees.</p>

<p>In Ammân, as we came to know later,
their industry had very unfortunate effects upon
the glorious ruins which adorn the hills on
either side: the basilica has wholly disappeared,
and one apse of the thermæ; but the Muchtar,
who may, perhaps, be likened to the mayor of
the town, has forbidden further depredations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
and, happily, the new population has not chosen
to establish itself among the ruins.</p>

<p>We had made no arrangements for our accommodation
in Ammân—a visit which had not
been included in the original programme. However,
we had been assured there was a "locanda"—it
is curious how many Italian words have
been accepted into Arabic—and as we had not
yet lunched we made our way thither without
loss of time. It was in the hands of Christians,
and, from the point of view of domestic arrangements,
Christianity is not a success among
Arabs; and, without entering into details, it
suffices to say that life can now hold no mysteries
for us in the matter of inns, nor, it may be
added, of domestic entomology.</p>

<p>Its full horrors were not revealed until we
went inside, and, in our circumstances, to go
indoors while we could remain without would
have shown a singular lack of imagination and
of the spirit of psychological inquiry. There
were two courts, an inner and an outer, and
those who had investigated certain obvious
details decided at once upon the outer, and,
accordingly, chairs were arranged round a deal
table under a vast apricot-tree—our eight horses,
with several other horses and donkeys, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
under a neighbouring apricot-tree. We then collected
our saddle-bags, and spread our luncheon,
after which we drank coffee for the good of
the house.</p>

<p>By-and-by a very smart young officer, speaking
French and German—educated at a military
academy in Austria—came to call upon the
Professor, and again we all had coffee. He
came as the representative of the officials of the
railway line. We were interested in the fact that,
unlike most other Arabs of our acquaintance,
he did not smoke, and said that he came of a
family of non-smokers.</p>

<p>His visit finished, we went off to see the ruins,
which lie on the hills on either side of a stream,
which we crossed on stepping-stones, though it is
said to be not fordable, even on horseback, in the
winter. Burckhardt, who was here in 1810,
speaks of the elaborate arrangements made for
the benefit of this water-supply, a rare natural
gift in the Belka. Not only the banks, but
the bed of the river was paved, in the manner
we had seen ourselves at Ba'albek and elsewhere;
and the water was full of fish, probably
the chub, which still exist here, and in the
Jabbok and Arnon, though ignored by the
Arabs, who do not care for fish, and who when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
they do kill them, with a view of selling them to
Europeans, pursue the wasteful and unsportsmanlike
method of a discharge of gunpowder!</p>

<p>The most impressive of the ruins, perhaps
because the least interfered with by modern
buildings, is the theatre. The stage has been
destroyed, but some forty tiers of seats still
remain visible, as well as about twenty-four
boxes, each capable of holding a dozen persons—traces
in all of places for some 3000 spectators.
Voices on the stage are still distinctly heard on
the farthest tier, although the acoustic properties
have probably suffered from the removal of parts
of the building. A fine colonnade, of which
several Corinthian columns, 15 feet high, still
remain, stood in front of the building, leading
to the river on the one hand and to a small
odeum on the other. Burckhardt was at a loss
to conjecture the nature of the latter building,
of which much more existed then than now:
the roof had fallen in, and made entrance difficult,
but the wall of the semicircular area was,
he says, richly decorated, The theatre is built
into the side of the hill in such a way that the
third tier of boxes is excavated in the solid
rock.</p>

<p>On the opposite side the ruins are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
numerous, but less impressive. A mosque, said to
be of the time of the Abbasides (eighth century),
stands almost side by side with a Byzantine
church; and a little to the north-east are the
remains of thermæ, which received water by
means of a conduit from the river. A street
of columns on the left bank of the stream, and
parallel with it, indicates the direction of the
high street of the town, nearly a thousand yards
long; while north of this stood a forum (by
some thought to be a temple) of a late Roman
date. The town was evidently walled, and
the street of columns was closed by gates
towards the east. We heard of many tombs,
sarcophagi, and remains of dwellings worth
seeing behind the town, but we had little
enough time to look at even what was of
primary interest. We were, however, thanks
to Circassian civilisation, more fortunate than
Burckhardt, whose guides forsook him, alarmed
by the sight of fresh horse-dung near the ruins,
and fearful of falling into the hands of the
Bedu. When reproached, they replied that they
did not see why they should expose themselves
to the danger of being stripped and robbed of
their horses, because of his foolish caprice of
writing down the stones!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
Burckhardt was not the first visitor. He
had been preceded by Seetzen in 1805-6, who,
however, left very little record of his travels in
Haurân and the Belka.</p>

<p>It was necessary to cut short our investigations
while enough daylight remained to allow
the Professor to pay a visit to the muchtar—a
visit worth recording on account of the extreme
contrast between our experience here and everywhere
else upon our journey. While we were
seeking for his house he seems to have had
intimation of our approach, for he received us
in the road, and, although he once uttered a
half-hearted <i>tfaddalu</i>, an invitation to enter
which we did not accept, contrary to all
Oriental custom and tradition, he showed no
desire whatever to entertain us. Elsewhere, to
turn away without coffee, repose, and cigarettes
would have been a mutual insult. He was
civil enough, but of the typical Circassian
moroseness, and his small meaningless features,
which, despite its reputation for beauty, were
characteristic of the race, never once lighted up
with even a passing gleam of sunshine.</p>

<p>It was dark under our apricot trees, when we
regained the courtyard of the inn, and while
we waited for supper we watched with interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
the scene around us, again struck by the contrast
with our accustomed Arab surroundings.
Where there are Arabs there are all the
elements of a comic opera: the bright colour,
the laughter, the ever-changing groups, the perpetual
singing—not individual egotistic singing,
but chorus, harmony, antiphon, with hand-clappings
and merry shouts. There are sudden, and,
apparently, inconsequent dances, and equally
sudden and inconsequent changes of mood,
drawing of knives, quarrels, embraces, and hand-shakings,
such as exist nowhere but among
Arabs, and on the lyric stage. Here, however,
it was no comic opera, but a transpontine drama
of the good old-fashioned sort—a novel by
"Monk" Lewis, or Thomas Love Peacock.
Men in long, dark drapery glided in and out
by the imperfect light of the single lantern
hung beneath the trees; they pulled their caps
low on their foreheads, and veiled their faces
with a cloak thrown over the left shoulder;
all carried arms, and seldom spoke, and then
only in low voices; the few Arabs present
were of the upper class, officers mainly, and
they seemed affected by the general depression,
and drank coffee and smoked their water-pipes
in silence. A single interruption served but to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
accentuate the prevailing mood. A drunken
man, a very rare spectacle in a Moslem country—a
Christian, of course—had reached the voluble
and affectionate stage, and assured us all, in a
variety of languages, of his perfect readiness
to oblige us in any direction. The audience
silently ignored his existence, and it was in vain
that our host led him again and again to the
gate: our polyglot friend invariably took affectionate
leave, and promptly returned. We felt
persuaded that the audience considered his
conduct merely another form of the Christian
eccentricity, of which our presence had already
supplied a curious example. We were all crazy
Franks—some drank wine, and others "wrote
down stones." Relief came at last, in the
person of the only woman we caught sight of
in Ammân, a stout Italian of determined aspect,
who withdrew her lord and master, not without
a certain amount of discussion, which must have
further enlightened our companions as to the
manners and customs of the superior races. In
spite of his irregularities the wretched creature
was not friendless. He was a wandering contractor
and builder, and possessed, we were
told, of some fifteen helpmates dispersed over
various parts of the country! Even our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
mukaris were silent for once: Khalil slept
over his water-pipe, and the boy was at his
usual evening task of patching the cloths which
hung beneath the horses to protect them from
the flies, and which they generally kicked into
rags in the course of the day. The beasts
themselves seemed asleep after their meal—the
only one, according to Arab custom, in the
twenty-four hours. Dogs and chickens stirred
now and then in dark corners, and cats crept
about with a fitting air of silence and mystery.</p>

<p>Presently our supper arrived: good bread,
good soup, good rice—one may always count on
good cooking among Arabs in this country—and
a fowl good to eat, although, to the eye,
too much <i>au naturel</i>, too suggestive of a boiled
corpse with wagging head, and legs so much in
their normal position as to be somewhat surprising
upon the dinner-table. Our host offered us
beer, and arrived with bottles and glasses in
hand, well knowing that at the end of a long,
hot day, and in our present surroundings with,
the dust and smell of a stable, a couple of
bottles cooled in running water, even at the
price of a franc and a half each, might be hard
to resist; but even the Sportsmen nobly looked
the other way, in the probably futile hope of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
classification apart from our fellow-Europeans,
who could be still heard carrying on a polyglot
exchange of compliments at the farther end of
the village. We solaced ourselves with tea,
and retired early, in the expectation, entirely
unfulfilled, of a long night's rest.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">There</span>
was no lingering in Ammân next
morning. From sheer habit of historic
reference we speculated as to whether it were
Ptolemy Philadelphus who, having rebuilt the
ancient city of Rabbath Ammân, and bequeathed
to it the name of Philadelphia, still used among
the Arabs, may have endowed it, moreover, so far
as our <i>locanda</i> was concerned, with one of the
most offensive of the ten plagues of his native land,
after which we did our best to forget our recent
experiences. We may remark in passing, however,
that traces, painful traces, lingered till later
in the day, when they were finally removed by
a dip in the strong current of the Jabbok, for
it had been in very mournful Gregorian cadence
that some of us had chanted "Moab is my washpot"
while a little water was poured on to our
hands out of a bottle by way of morning ablution.

failed the party, it was never the spirit of cheerful
resignation.</p>

<p>We have not yet sung the praise of the early
start! One must come to the East to learn
to the full the beauty of the morning and of
the night, as well as, <i>inter alia</i>, of life without
fogs and coal fires and bad cooking; of life
where houses are spacious and servants serve,
and a napoleon goes further than a sovereign,
and the post comes but once a week or so,
and newspapers are not.</p>

<p>There is here none of the discomfort of the
early start at home—no shivering over ice-cold
water, no closed shutters, no bolted front door,
no makeshift breakfast brought by the wrong
servant in incomplete toilet. No matter how
early you rise the world is up before you; you
can have as much at five o'clock as at nine.
Your horse is a little stable stiff; but he is as
pleased with the early start as you, and he
snuffs the dewy air with æsthetic enjoyment.
In the hollows of the mountains a mist wreath
is lying; here and there a few clouds even may
hang low to the west—but you know they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
only dew, and that even now in October we
are perfectly certain of a fine day, with at
least another thirty to follow. You are invigorated,
encouraged in mind and body for the
whole day, even when, as in our case, you know
that the day will last for ten or twelve hours.</p>

<p>Almost immediately on leaving the village
we began to climb—for, although Ammân is
2747 feet above sea-level, the town itself is in
a hollow—and soon found ourselves on an excellent
Roman road. The particular pleasure
which the Professor had promised us for this
day's journey was that we should do homage at
the tomb of Abdel Azziz en-Nimr Shech Adwân,
more often spoken of as Nimr, a great poet, of
the Bedu tribe of the Adwân, who addressed
a great number of poems to Watka, his twenty-fourth
wife. We had heard one of his poems
recited by our Bedawy escort, and we were
willing to take the Professor's word for the rest;
for the poet's works have been collected by but
one editor, who has not yet published them,
and the two or three writers who mention
the spot at all do so mainly in connection with
a certain Shech Goblan, who, before Jerash
and Ammân were given over to the Circassians,
was much feared throughout the district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
About two hours after leaving Ammân we
reached the Wady el-Hammam, and, a little later,
Yajûz, a large Bedu cemetery on the side of a
hill, strewn with columns, capitals, and hewn
stones, obviously the remains of a Roman town.
Some great stone troughs, which may have been
sarcophagi, attracted the attention of our horses
on account of the water they contained, and we
gladly dismounted, and left them to such refreshment
as was provided by the very muddy spring,
while we climbed the hill a short distance to the
tomb of our laureate, who may certainly be
regarded as having an experimental knowledge
of what characteristics were most acceptable in
a wife, and whose eulogy of Watka should at
least have the merit of discrimination.</p>

<p>The whole hillside was covered with graves,
and some curious combinations presented themselves.
There the tomb of some landowner was
marked by a plough, the inconceivably primitive
instrument with which the fellah scratches the
surface of the fertile soil; there a fragment of the
blue cotton, which is the inevitable dress of the
Bedu, twisted round a stick, shows where some
woman has been laid to rest; farther again, a
stone, roughly sculptured with the instruments of
coffee-making, celebrates the hospitality of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
unnamed shech; and, in strange contrast with
the savagery of to-day, we step over a sculptured
capital or carven pillar, memorial of the art and
culture of nigh two thousand years ago; while,
reminder that "extremes meet," our thoughts
are carried back yet another thousand years at
sight of the welys—tombs of Moslem saints—standing
apart on mounds, shadowed with ancient
oaks, where the pious come to worship to-day,
to the Israelites who did so of old time, "upon
every high hill and under every green tree."</p>

<p>Around the spring were groups of women, with
the tattooed faces, hanging veils, and curious
long, narrow dresses of the East Jordan Bedu,
barely wide enough to stride in, but lying at least
a yard upon the ground, front and back, so that
when they walk the skirt has to be kilted, often
to the entire violation of such ideas of modesty
as may have originally dictated its design. They
had taken much interest in the Lady, and, as usual,
had speculated as to which of her companions
might be her proprietor—always the first point to
ascertain—the remaining matters of curiosity in
regard to a woman being: What did she cost?
and How many boys has she?—after which they
frankly discuss her "points," and express surprise
at the smallness of her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
Suddenly there was an instant's silence; all
eyes were turned southward, where a procession
had just come into sight winding up the valley.
A weird, melancholy song broke out, the women
pressed forward, and we realised that a funeral
was advancing. We had already observed a
newly-made grave; but the procession passed it
by, and halted beside the nearest wely, under a
group of trees. The four men who carried the
bier laid it gently down, and the women, with
loud cries, gathered about it on the ground. The
body was that of a woman, so closely wrapped in
her dress and veil that we could only perceive
that she was slender. All joined in the loud wailing,
led, apparently, by a professional mourner,
who sat beside the corpse, beating her breast, and
throwing dust upon her head. It was a pathetic
evidence of the homogeneousness of humankind,
despite differences of custom, that those
who really wept, silently and apart, were, we
understood, the mother and mother-in-law of the
dead, while a young man who leant alone against
a tree trunk was the newly-married husband
of a three days' bride. She had died, they said,
of a sudden illness, the description of which
suggested measles or small-pox. We could not
but think of the little home made desolate, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
plans and hopes never to be realised, of the
bereaved husband—for here, among the Bedu,
marriage is a matter of choice and not of
compulsion, as among the Arabs of the towns—of
the poor girl herself, who, having reached
what is the main object of existence among the
Orientals, had been called away just as life was
opening. Our point of view may have been a
little too Occidental, or it may have been another
case of "extremes meet," the mean being represented
by the higher civilisation of Khalil, a true
Jerusalemite, for his one remark was: "It was a
pity the bridegroom had had no use out of his
bargain when he had paid so much for her!"</p>

<p>The young man was presented to the Professor,
who expressed our respectful sympathy, and we
turned away after a last glance at the loud-wailing
group of the indifferent, the silent sadness
of those most concerned. Whatever the age
or race, "Light sorrows speak, great grief is
dumb."</p>

<p>When we left the wady we climbed a precipitous
hill, and found ourselves overlooking a
deep gorge to our left—the Wady er-Rumman—where
abundant verdure showed the presence of
water—a rare sight to our eyes, habituated to
the aridity of Jerusalem, where running water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
is so utterly unknown that if for a few hours
once a year, after exceptionally heavy rain, it is
reported that the Kedron flows, the whole population
turns out to witness so extraordinary a
phenomenon. As a matter of fact, moreover,
the Kedron does not flow, unless far underground,
and only a spring—the well of Job or
Joab—overflows into the Kedron bed, but the
fact is always thus described. Further, we
crossed a small tributary stream, where we
found a number of shepherds and herdsmen,
with camels and sheep and goats. By this
time our horses were hot with the climb, and we
were forced to deny them the desired refreshment,
and hastened on, already somewhat occupied
with thoughts of the luncheon promised
to us at the fords of Jabbok. When we came—some
of us riding in advance with the officer—to
a pleasant stream shaded by oleanders we
thought he must be mistaken in riding resolutely
forward, for we were not yet used to a district
in which two streams might be passed in a single
day, and were half inclined to wait for those
behind. However, we pressed on, and, as no
shouts followed us, were glad to have made so
much way that it was possible to dismount and
rest our horses for a few moments, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
Jabbok, it appeared, was still distant—"over
two hills," declared Khalil, when he at last overtook
us. They were somewhat stiff hills both
to climb and to descend, and not Jacob himself,
with his two wives and two women-servants
and eleven sons, and all his other anxieties,
could have been more glad than we, when, from
our last ascent, we saw beneath us a wide
expanse of fresh green, showing that we had
reached the fords of Jabbok. The river, rising
from streams in the hills above Ammân, and
sweeping round by the north-west before taking
a sudden turn towards the Jordan, accomplishes
a journey of sixty miles, not counting its windings,
to reach the point which, at starting, was
only eighteen miles away. In its descent of
some three thousand feet its current gains great
swiftness, and it rushes with considerable
violence over its rocky bed, as the widely-scattered
pebbles—white and water-worn—abundantly
testify. Two roads follow its course;
and though but a couple of distant villages were
in sight, the cultivated land all along its banks
showed the near presence of active humanity:
a deserted mill among the bushes, and a few
fellahin watering their cattle, were, however,
our only reminder of human life. We were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
free to picture any chapter in its history which
might strike our imagination—Jacob, occupied
with all his family cares and apprehensions,
suddenly called upon in the darkness to remember
the world of the Unseen; Gideon
pursuing the Midianites; the hosts of Chosroes
marching from Damascus to the Nile; the
Roman legionaries constructing the very road
which we have followed to-day; Galilean pilgrims
coming up to the Jerusalem feasts by
way of Peræa; the propagandists of the Prophet
hastening to the north; and lastly, and more
enduring than all, the fellahin, with their elementary
agriculture, seeking their daily bread like
the swallows that are darting overhead or the
rat that splashes into the stream, oblivious and
indifferent to all other life, and, therefore, permanent
and persistent in their own.</p>

<p>For ourselves, however, the fords of Jabbok
represented primarily the means of taking a bath,
and secondarily, those of making tea. The sun
was still hot; we had descended considerably
since leaving Ammân, and the bushes offered
welcome shade. The Circassian soldier brought
the Lady a handful of ripe blackberries—the first
we had seen in Syria, where blackberries are
abundant enough, but for lack of moisture never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
seem to ripen. The oleanders, with their rich
crimson; the rare feast of abundant verdure; the
grey water rushing upon its white bed, with the
effect of blue which gives to the Jabbok its
modern name of Ez-Zerka—"the Blue"; the
contented horses cooling their limbs in a deep
pool, made a vision we were loth to disturb; but
we were already late, and after an hour's repose
were bidden to mount once more. When we
had crossed the rushing ford and regained the
plateau we realised that our shadows were
already lengthening.</p>

<p>We had now crossed an important political
boundary, for the Jabbok is one of the three
rivers at right angles with the Jordan—the
Arnon, Jabbok, and Yarmuk—which divide
Eastern Palestine into three provinces; physically,
as well as, for the most part, politically,
though their disentanglement is difficult, distinct.
Behind us was the Belka, the land of Ammon
and Moab, practically the Peræa of ancient
history, in the time of the Herods politically
associated with Galilee, and always regarded
by the Jew as being as much a Jewish province
as Judæa or Galilee. The climate of the Belka
is temperate, and in spite of insufficient water at
its highest points the treeless plateau is ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
fresh and breezy, providing pasture for innumerable
herds. It is but seventy miles from the
orange gardens of the Philistine plain, but eight
hours' direct ride from the palms of Jericho, and
yet the Arabs have a proverb: "They said to
the Cold: 'Where shall we find thee?' And he
answered: 'In the Belka.' 'And if not there?'
'In Baalbek is my home.'" Now Baalbek, as
we saw it in August, lies under the shadow of
snowcapped mountains.</p>

<p>Now we were coming into 'Ajlûn, the land
of Gilead, "the region of Decapolis," a district
of forests—falling, alas! before the axe of the
Circassian—of springs and streams, tributaries of
the Jordan as well as of the Jabbok and the
Yarmuk; the land whence "a company of
Ishmaelites came with their camels, bearing
spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it
down to Egypt." There is still "balm in
Gilead." We had scarcely crossed the river
when our soldier, stooping from his saddle,
snatched a handful of deliciously fragrant herbs,
which he presented to the Lady, who had no
opportunity of verifying their species, but was
quite prepared to believe that she had enjoyed
the sweetness of the <i>balsamum Gileadense</i>, though
with suppressed misgivings that it might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
only the <i>melissa officinalis</i>. Indeed, the low
growth of <i>artemisia</i> and other herbs throughout
this region is so sweet that, in the wilder parts
of the Belka frequented by gazelle, which feed
upon it, the Arabs constantly pick up their
droppings for the pleasure of the fragrance.</p>

<p>Low ranges of hills to the east lay between
us and that far-away fascination of the desert
of which we had first, and most fully, realised
the spell at Mshatta, making us feel that we
were, in some degree, coming once more into
touch with humanity and the commonplace of
life, and farther away from that dim region
known to so few, and which throughout history
has always been the great source of danger,
the check upon the civilisation of East Jordan,
ever open to the great hungry desert, whence
in all ages wild tribes have come forth to seek
sustenance from the fertile tablelands of Bashan,
Gilead, and Moab.</p>

<p>Here not Nature and the desert but Art
and Greece were the prominent facts in the
minds of some among us. Ammân, fresh in
our memory, had been already an important
stronghold two hundred years before Christ, and,
later, a member of the Decapolis, although, alone
of the ten cites, lying south of the Jabbok.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
Here, as never before, were we able to realise
something of the nature and meaning of that
mysterious alliance of the Decapolis, of which
the origin is unknown, but which we had seen
represented in miniature in the present-day
policy of playing off the Circassians against the
Bedawy tribes of that same district, which, even
two thousand years ago, was then, as now, the
check upon all prosperity and progress. There
seems little doubt that this confederacy—like
the Arab dynasty of the Ghassanides at a later
date under Trajan—was intended to balance
these Semitic influences; and these cities were
thoroughly Hellenic, not only in art and
culture, but, unlike other parts of Eastern
Palestine, in religion also, the cult of Astarte
alone being borrowed from their surroundings.
Most of them were placed, like Ammân, on
either side of a stream, with fertile land all
round about, not on a hill, as was the Semitic
custom, to judge from the positions of most of
the villages one sees west of the Jordan. Their
pastimes, too, were Greek—the theatres, the
bath, the circus. All had the street of columns,
the forum, the temples such as we had seen
at Ammân; each was approached by just such
a road as we were treading now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
While we talked and mused the sun had
set, the short evening glow was in the west,
and we were soon cautiously walking our horses
in the dim twilight. Suddenly a stately arch
reared itself against the fading sky; while beyond,
far as the eye could reach, dusky columns arose
against the background of the dark hillside.
Before we could take in the scene the veil of
night had fallen, for here in the East "with
one stride comes the dark." We could see no
longer; but we knew we were descending into
a valley, for the sound of the rushing stream at
the bottom seemed to get nearer, till at last
we felt that our horses' feet were in the water.
The village was asleep, but few lights shone
from the windows of the frugal Circassian inhabitants,
and we could only trust to our kindly
animals, who were taking their lead from that
of the officer, who rode in advance. We were
ascending a very steep hill; soon we had
reached level ground, and we awaited the coming
of the responsible members of our party. Looking
back we could see the great lordly columns
standing out snow-white in the starlight, monuments
 of a race, an age, a system, a religion
that had perished like last year's snow, leaving
not a link with to-day, except that common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
aspiration after happiness, present and future,
which had inspired the existence of the Past,
as it still inspires those who gaze upon its
monuments. Never had the Past seemed to
stoop towards us as now in this eastern starlight,
and it seemed as if we might almost
hope for answer when we asked:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="small">

<div class="verse quote">"Gods of Hellas, gods of Hellas,</div>
<div class="verse">Can ye listen in your silence,</div>
<div class="verse">Can your mystic voices tell us</div>
<div class="verse">Where ye hide?"</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Surely somewhere in the Past there must be
a voice; the intense Life which had created
yonder city could not be wholly dead; all that
was beautiful and true must somewhere, somehow,
be living still! We were roused from
our meditations by the cheery voice of the
Professor calling out of the darkness to know
whether any were missing among us. We were
close by the house of the mudir, and could
even see the guards and servants assembled in
the lighted portico. It was an anxious moment,
for it depended upon the nature of his reception
whether we had hospitable entertainment or
were cast adrift upon the resources of the village,
as had been the case last night in Ammân.
We rallied our forces, dismounted from our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
horses, and presented ourselves and our credentials.</p>

<p>We were very thankful when the door was
at once unlocked, and we were admitted into
the guest-room, a large apartment, with a high
divan running its entire length provided with
cushions, a few chairs, a round table in one
corner, and on the deep window-ledges great
piles of very official-looking papers. We were
too tired to criticise our accommodation, which
was, at all events, infinitely superior to that of
the night before, and thankfully seated ourselves.
Meantime the news of the Professor's arrival
had evidently reached the mudir himself, for
in a few minutes the scene was changed: three
or four servants appeared, the floor was spread
with two magnificent carpets, either of which
would have been the pride of any London
drawing-room, additional lights and some extra
chairs were brought in, and nothing was needed
but a duster, which, however, did not appear.
The Lady surreptitiously cleaned the table, the
carpets having stirred the æstheticism which
our Ammân experiences had put to sleep, and
we deposited our head-gear. The men removed
their shoes, and placed themselves on the high
divan; the Lady, unable to emulate so lofty an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
example, seized some cushions, and established
herself upon the floor, secure of violating no
Oriental etiquette, and, by the Professor's direction,
covered her head with her keffeeye, which
was, he said, more distinguished under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>Next the mudir himself appeared—'Abd el-hamid
Bey, son of Nūh Bey, already mentioned—a
fine-looking man in European dress, who shook
hands cordially with all the party, and assured
us of our welcome, and coffee was at once served.
To say that it was coffee with hêhl conveys
nothing to the Occidental understanding, and
mere words fail to express all that hêhl can add
to a cup of coffee. It is nectar and ambrosia
brewed in Olympus; it is a taste and a perfume,
a stimulus and a sedative. For centuries we
have been drinking coffee—unimaginative Occidentals
that we are!—and nobody has taught us
the virtues of hêhl. It is only a bean, portable,
one would suppose, conceivably an article of
commerce, or which might be cultivated or
otherwise introduced, although how, on second
thoughts, it would combine with the beverage
we profanely call "coffee" is another matter.
Coffee worth the drinking must be roasted,
crushed (in Heaven's name not ground!), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
made while you wait, not brought in paper bags
from the grocer, and kept for weeks. It is
brought to the door of the room in the brass
pot in which it was made, and poured out
tenderly as a butler pours out a perfumed wine,
leaving space at the top of the cup, small as it
is, for the aroma.</p>

<p>After coffee we entered into conversation—that
is to say, the Professor did—with the mudir,
the Arabic-speaking Sportsman being occasionally
called in when their Arabic vocabulary ran
short; for to both it was a foreign language, the
mudir, as has already been seen, being a Circassian.
He remembered the names of the few
savants and other travellers who had passed
that way, and inquired after all, asked particulars
as to our journey and as to the personality of
each, exhibited some polite surprise at the presence
of the Lady in these distant regions, and
still more that she was not the property of any
of her fellow-travellers. He showed great concern
as to her comfort, sent for additional
cushions, and several times personally addressed
her. He is known as a man of exceptional
intelligence and breadth of mind, and of a
friendly and amiable disposition, in striking contrast
to the average Circassian, who is said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
be treacherous and morose. He is quite an
important person, having at his command from
ten to fifteen mounted <i>gens-d'armes</i>, and when
he goes eastward among the neighbouring tribe
of the Beni Hasan for the collection of taxes is
accompanied by as many regular soldiers, with
their officer. He settles small differences and
disputes, and, says Dr Schumacher, carries a few
bullet-holes in his coat as token of his office of
peacemaker. More serious cases are taken by
both Bedu and fellahin before the Mutesarrif
(Governor) of Haurân.</p>

<p>While conversation proceeded we could hear
most welcome sounds without—chopping, frying,
beating of eggs; and, after a second edition of
coffee, two servants entered, carrying a large
cotton drugget, which was spread over the
carpet, and upon which was set the Sanīye, a
large round tray, placed upon an X-shaped stand,
which raised it several inches from the ground.
We all seated ourselves on the floor, as well as
our host and another guest, a very intelligent
man, and a great talker, but less adapted than
the mudir to polite society.</p>

<p>Each guest had a large slice of excellent
wholemeal bread, and each had a spoon and a
towel. There were two dishes of meat, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
vegetables, two of rice, two of fried eggs, and
two basins of pomegranate juice, exquisite in
colour and delicious to the taste. Everything
was very good, well cooked, and neatly served.
It was etiquette to help yourself to any dish,
and in any rotation you fancied, putting in your
spoon, and conveying the food direct to your
mouth—a custom which had its drawbacks, as
the Lady found when she fixed her affections on
pomegranate juice, and found it becoming gradually
impregnated with onions, as her neighbour,
the Bey, our fellow-guest, was alternating it
with mouthfuls of stewed mutton. The hospitable
mudir constantly pressed us to eat, inquiring,
when the Lady's appetite failed, whether there
were anything else she would prefer. Finally
we all adjourned to the doorstep to have water
poured upon our hands. Then followed more
coffee, always with hêhl, cigarettes, and, after
half-an-hour, the samovar. If the coffee had
been worthy of the Bedu the tea was worthy
of Russia. We drank it, of course, in tumblers,
with crystallised sugar and floating slices of
lemon, and we stirred it with spoons of heavy
silver, beautifully chased and enamelled.</p>

<p>Then came more conversation, mainly political,
and it was very interesting to hear the mudir's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
emphatic repudiation of prejudice, national or
religious, especially since the Circassians are
accused of fanaticism and of hatred of Europeans.
"It was all one to him," he averred—"Moslems,
Jews, Nazarenes!" Two or three servants
stood by the whole time, and one could not
but contrast the perfection and apparent readiness
of their service with that of the superior
domestics at home. They perceived your needs
before you could find them out yourself, and tea,
or bread, or sugar, or a match, as the case
might be, was ready to your use before you
were aware that you needed it. Bread or sugar
was brought in the fingers, it is true; but knives
there were none, and spoons were scarce.</p>

<p>The Lady gave the signal for retirement by
frankly falling asleep among her cushions. Retirement,
as a matter of fact, there was none;
but mattresses, pillows, and lehafs (wadded
coverlets) were brought in, and laid side by
side upon the floor. The Lady's bed, lehaf, and
cushions were covered with rich crimson satin.
An ornamental sheet of white cotton, with a
coloured design, was spread upon the mattress;
the silk cushions, as is the cleanly Eastern
custom, had an embroidered breadth of cotton
down the centre, and the lehaf had a sheet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
of fine cotton tacked to it upon the under side.
Thus luxuriously accommodated we all slept so
comfortably that we were able to think of
Ammân next morning as a nightmare of the
past. We must, however, acknowledge that
during the early part of the night we were
occasionally awakened by the conversation outside
the door, probably of our escort and the
servants; for in this country, where men rise at
dawn, sleep odd half-hours anywhere, and at
any time in the day, they may or may not go
to bed at night if they should happen to find
anything more amusing to do. However, when
at last the Professor went outside to suggest
silence and the extinction of lights, they most
obligingly met his views at once.</p>

<p>Next morning we rose about six from our
silken couches, and went outside the door in
search of towels and a piece of soap, and poured
water into each other's hands wherewith to make
such ablution as was possible under very public
conditions; for, though there was none of the
ill-mannered staring and crowding around of
the Madaba Christians, the Circassians condescended
to a little distant curiosity, and
even a couple of women appeared upon an
opposite housetop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
We knew that a very long day was before us,
and we had hoped to start early, but our host
detained us with kindly importunity. When he
appeared upon the scene our bedroom had once
more become a drawing-room, and we had taken
our early cup of coffee. Then followed more
coffee, and then the samovar, with bread and
excellent goat's-milk cheese; and finally the
mudir's son, a fresh, open-faced, young man,
appeared, mounted on a beautiful mare, to accompany
us across the valley to the ruined city
on the western side.</p>

<p>From the terrace outside the mudir's house
we had already taken in the general effect—all
the more striking and wonderful that the old
town has not been defaced by a single modern
building, and hence is far more easily reconstructed
by the imagination than Madaba, or
even Ammân—a fact for which the history of
the settlement, rather than any æsthetic perception,
accounts. When the followers of the
Emir Nūh Bey arrived at Jerash he took
possession of the east side of the valley for the
use of his immediate family and attendants,
reserving the opposite bank for relatives who
were to follow. For various reasons—possibly
the accounts of discord with the Bedu, possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
even some diplomacy on the part of the family
here—they have not, so far, arrived, and some
two hundred immigrants who came in 1895 were
passed on southward. There seems to be some
difference of opinion as to the extent of the
population, Baedeker giving it at three hundred;
Schumacher, whose very interesting monograph
is the only other available source of information,
at between fifteen and sixteen hundred souls,
including some score of fellahin, who serve as
labourers and ploughmen, and a few Moslem
shopkeepers, Here, as in Ammân, we saw not
a single woman in the streets.</p>

<p>The ruins are so extensive, and stand out so
clear against the hillside, that, with the Professor's
help in identifying the buildings, it was
easy, from the east side of the valley, to reconstruct
in imagination a town which imagination
only can picture, so utterly different is it from
the banalities and vulgarities of modern utilitarianism.</p>

<p>Owing to the harder qualities of the stone
the ruins are better preserved than those at
Ammân, have lost less of their original sharpness,
and have the freshness so remarkable
at Pompeii. And yet an Arabic writer of the
thirteenth century, Yakut, describes it even then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
"as a great city now a ruin." In the ninth
century it was mentioned with admiration by
the earlier writer, Yakubi, although its decline
probably began with the expulsion of the
Byzantines.</p>

<p>The most striking features of the scene before
us are its highest point, the Temple of the Sun;
its most southern point, the triumphal arch
leading towards the Roman road to Ammân;
and the great colonnade, of which over a hundred
pillars are still standing, running from
one end to the other of the city. There are
two large theatres, two temples, a great oval
forum, four bridges, and at each of the two
points at which the main street, with its
propylæa, is intersected by side streets, there
is a tetrapylon, a rotunda, square on the exterior
and once decorated with statues. The town was
pear-shaped, and enclosed by walls 3552 metres
long, having at least three, probably six or
seven, gates.</p>

<p>This is a mere enumeration; of such a feast
of beauty for the lover of form it is almost
hopeless to attempt description. As we descended,
and took a few points in detail, we
realised that, with the amount of time at our
disposal, even to catalogue such a scene was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
an impossibility. At the utmost we could but
note a few of the more obvious features, and
we longed for a few days to dispose of.</p>

<p>Crossing the main street with its great
colonnade, many of its splendid pillars lying
on the ground, overthrown by earthquakes, we
pass the ruins of grand propylæa and of a
ruined palace, and, climbing an almost perpendicular
ascent, reach the great Temple of
the Sun, enclosed by a colonnade, with a portico
approached by steps, consisting of three rows
of immense Corinthian columns, 38 feet high
and 6 feet thick, the acanthus leaves of the
capitals being of rare perfection of workmanship.
Smaller temples have stood around it, and,
descending again, turning our horses' heads a
little northward, we find a theatre with sixteen
tiers of seats, and a proscenium strikingly low,
intended, it is said, for gladiatorial combats and
exhibitions of wild beasts. This theatre, like the
temple, is joined to the main street by a colonnade
and tetrapylon, the rotunda of which was
once decorated with statues. The forum next
attracted us. It is of oval shape, 120 paces in
length, and fifty-five of its columns are still
standing, all having Ionic capitals. Another
temple, smaller than the first, lies near the south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
gate. Its massive walls, 7½ feet thick, contain
many niches and windows; the double Corinthian
colonnade is scattered far and wide, though the
bases are easily traced, and the little that remains
testifies to the former grace of the building.</p>

<p>Close beside this is a large theatre facing
towards the north, so that the spectators must
have had a magnificent background of their
familiar public buildings. Twenty-eight tiers
of seats are visible, but probably others lie
buried in the débris. It is estimated that the
acoustic properties of the building must have
been excellent, and that at least 5000 spectators
could enjoy the spectacle. We observed an
arrangement upon the pillars for the hanging
of garlands. Beyond the south exit in the
town wall is the Triumphal gateway; according
to some the two gateways were alike, forming
a splendid vista as one approached the town,
each being of triple construction—the central
arch 29 feet in height, the total width 82 feet.
There are considerable remains of an interesting
building, thought by some to be a naumachia,
or theatre for the representation of naval
battles. That there exists a circus, of which
many rows of seats still remain, cannot be
doubted; but recent authorities are of opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
that the adjoining basin, 230 yards in length
by 100 yards in width, into which well-preserved
channels lead the water from the brook
below, must have served some other purpose.</p>

<p>We could not but regret that the lateness of
our start cut short our opportunity for further
enjoyment of the scene; but a day of ten or
twelve hours was before us, and we soon found
ourselves once more upon the Roman road,
with our horses turned towards the south.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<small>ES-SALT</small></h3>

<p class="center small">"And fade into the light of common day."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">We</span>
knew, when we had lost sight of Jerash,
that the romance of our journey was
over, although we had still before us three days
of the happiness of an open-air life, and of
being face to face with Nature in her wilder
utterances. We were bound for Es-Salt, across
the fertile land of Gilead, and over some of
the highest ground east of the Jordan; but we
could not but feel that, having looked upon
"the giant forms of empires on their way to
ruin," all else must seem commonplace, so far,
at least, as it was associated with humanity.
The land had relapsed into the hands of a
people perhaps even more rudimentary than
that from which it had been wrested, or, so far
as the city of Es-Salt was concerned, into the
worse savagery of a veneer of Europeanism.</p>

<p>We were not sorry to have to retrace, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
some two hours, our steps of last night, and
so recover some of the impressions which we
had lost in the gathering twilight. We halted,
for a short time only, at the fords of Jabbok,
after which we followed a steep path for about
half-an-hour, and then began to descend into
the Wady El-Mastaba, a desolate gorge, shadeless
and hot, from whence we were glad to
escape again into the open, passing a few huts,
which constitute the village of Mastaba, which
owes its existence to the spring Ain El-Mastaba.
Again another gorge, the Wady Umm Rabi,
also with its spring; and a third, and more important
wady and spring, with its village of
some thirty huts, Er-Rummâna, which yesterday
we had seen only in the distance. It is inhabited
almost entirely by Turcomans, who, as
usual, betray their nationality by the scarlet
and orange touches in their dress—an agreeable
change from the perpetual blue of the Arab.
These nomadic tribes are to the settled Turks
as the Bedu to the fixed population of the
Arabs. They are fair, of less pronounced
features than their Semitic neighbours, and
most numerous in the north of Syria. They
are occupied partly in agriculture, but more
especially in cattle and camel rearing. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
passed some women at a spring, and their
manners struck us as having something of
Circassian moroseness.</p>

<p>Just beyond the village the horizon widened,
and showed, away to the west, the distant
Samaritan hills, half way between us and the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Presently we came to the edge of the tableland,
and saw far below us the fertile gorge
of Wâdi Salîhi. Here, we had been assured,
we should find a beautiful waterfall, 60 feet in
height, and embowered in creepers—a phenomenon
almost unknown in Palestine. We never
saw that waterfall; and we had a secret theory,
some of us, that "Someone had blundered,"
for we were, moreover, required to descend a
precipice calculated to disturb the nerves of
even such experienced travellers as we considered
ourselves to be. Some traces of a
passing donkey were the only argument which—about
half way down—seemed to be in favour
of a prospect of ever reaching the bottom,
which, however, was in course of time safely
achieved. We were much impressed by the
agility of the baggage animals, which clumsily,
rather than heavily, laden, and wisely abandoned
by the mukaris, picked their way as skilfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
and daintily as cats, although it would be
difficult to say whether the loose shale that
crumbled beneath one's feet, or the polished
rock, which offered no foothold at all, was the
more disconcerting.</p>

<p>Down in the valley we found abundant shade,
and the bushes were fresh and green, but the
water in the wady was so low and muddy that
we were the more convinced that we had entirely
missed all traces of the waterfall. The
horses, after the recent excitement, were thankful
to drink, and we gladly spread our luncheon
and made some coffee. In missing our waterfall
we had also missed an interesting cromlech,
said to be 13 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>About seven hours after leaving Jerash we
entered the Wady Er-Rumemin, where we forded
a brook which serves to turn two or three mills,
and waters the small plain into which the valley
finally opens. Here we found the first traces
of Christianity since leaving Madaba, always
excepting the locanda at Ammân: an orderly
village with a Latin and a Greek church,
school, and presbytery, well-planted olive
grounds and neatly-kept vegetable gardens.
We were already late, and dared not stay
to examine a group of ruins to the west of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
the Latin church, still less others which, we
were told, lay at a little distance.</p>

<p>Leaving the village by the right bank of the
wady, now called El-Hor, we climbed a steep hill,
and found ourselves in a beautiful oak wood.</p>

<p>As over a score of varieties of oaks are found
in Palestine they are somewhat difficult to distinguish,
but some at least of these were of the
species <i>quercus ægilops</i>, having acorns with scales,
the cups of which may be familiarly described
as looking like miniature pineapples. They are
used in tanning, and, as they form quite an
important article of commerce, the trees are
treated with more respect than is usual among
the destructive fellahin.</p>

<p>During the winter one meets, coming into
Jerusalem, whole caravans laden with great
roots of trees, dug up for sale by the peasants
of the mountains, and from this, as well as
from tradition, we may well suppose that whole
districts have been denuded of their forests.
We are told, however, by various authorities
that woods as we know them, lofty, as well as
thick with undergrowth, have never existed here,
and that such wood as we were now passing
through is of the normal type, the growth open
and scattered, and the trees thick rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
high. The undergrowth seemed to consist
largely of dwarf oak and terebinth, and as we
progressed farther, and the wood became thicker,
of pine and thorn.</p>

<p>With thick foliage on either side, and lofty
hills before us, we hardly realised that the sun
was setting when it was suddenly night. Our
cavalcade closed up together, and those in front
were constantly calling back to others to beware
of stretching branches or other difficulties of the
path. The very horses, with the instinct of
self-protection, in a country where other protection
does not exist, kept close to each other.
Our officer hurried to the front at sound of voices
and movement, the mukaris brought up the rear,
and the Lady's horse was secured by a rope to
that of one of the men. An opening in the
trees revealed a camp of charcoal-burners, and
as we once more began to ascend we could see
the lurid flames of others of the same trade,
lighting up the surrounding hilltops, and making
the darkness around seem all the more substantial.
It was a darkness which might be felt. We
knew, from occasional contact with the branches,
that we were still in thick woodland, and as we
began to climb once more, the path was so
narrow and so perpendicular that our horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
could go only in single file. All but the Professor
and the Lady dismounted, rather from humanity
than for safety, for the animals' sense of direction
was better than ours. As usual on occasions of
anxiety, no one spoke. Suddenly a shout arose
out of the darkness, and the horses halted; while
those on foot pressed on to know the cause, and
the Professor, who was in advance, sent back
his electric lantern. One of the baggage horses
had found his bulk too great for the narrow
passage, and the way was blocked by his entanglement.
It took some time to set him free
and to ascertain that nothing was lost from
his various burdens. As we waited in the dense
blackness of the wood, the poor animals struggling
for foothold on the steep ascent, the smell
of the hyænas was almost nauseating, and the
cries of troops of jackals, answering each other
out of the darkness, lent a weird touch to our
surroundings.</p>

<p>Presently the obstacle was removed, and we
were able to continue in the direction of our
oriflamme—the spark of light which showed that
the Professor, with his lantern, had reached a spot
where he could safely await our arrival. A fervent
<i>Alhamdul-Illah!</i> ("God be thanked!") from
one of our mukaris bringing up the rear, showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
that the horses at least were safe; and in a few
minutes the stragglers on foot had joined the
group, one at least having special cause for
thankfulness, as he had had a very narrow escape
from a fall over an unsuspected precipice. To
see each other was still impossible, and a startled
<i>wain es-Sitt?</i> ("Where is the Lady?") uttered close
beside her, almost gave her pleasure, not from
any desire to give trouble to her friends, but
rather as assurance that she had not already
done so, for there had been moments of which
some of us hardly yet felt competent to give
an account.</p>

<p>The look backward, from the high ground we
had reached, was a spectacle not to be forgotten.
Three huge fires flamed high against the great
dome of night, which, now that we were out
in the open, was perceptible in the clear starlight,
and no longer the wall of dense blackness which
had seemed to press against our very eyeballs.
Moreover, behind us, to the north-east, the moon
was rising from behind the Jebel Osha, a
mountain 3595 feet high, associated with the
prophet Hosea, said to have been born and
buried here. The Bedu have a wely containing
his grave, about 16 feet long, for all the great
men of old were giants, and here they annually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
sacrifice sheep in his honour. We felt, as we
heard the story, that a sacrifice to the rising
moon would be less of an anachronism than we
were accustomed to suppose, so thankful were
we to have some notion of where the next step
would lead us.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Es-Salt were extraordinarily
remote, and we asked Khalil if we were not near,
with a faint hope that a light we could see away
down in the valley might represent the windows
of the convent upon whose hospitality we
counted, and when he replied: "After two hills,"
we were even inclined to suppose it a <i>façon de
parler</i>, equivalent to "by-and-by." However,
he was right enough, and we had to descend
and climb, and again to descend and climb
before, below, up the valley to our left, the town
became visible. The light we had counted upon,
proved to be again that of charcoal-burners, and
a most Satanic spectacle it was, for we came near
enough to see a group of figures dancing and
leaping against the flaming background.</p>

<p>The last descent was somewhat of a pendant,
except that it was on open ground and by moonlight,
to our perpendicular ascent in the wood,
and a row of telegraph posts at the bottom
seemed to add insult to our injuries: the affectation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
of an effort at civilisation which we felt
had been better expended in the clearing of a
few rocks and the construction of, let us say,
some kind of path. Again, most of the party
dismounted, and it was interesting to observe
how cleverly the animals picked their way, even
the laden baggage animals. When now and
then they went, for convenience, a little wide
of the ultimate point, we noted with interest
how they came at a call from the mukaris—each
animal having his own name, to which he readily
responded. It may be mentioned in passing
that, so willing and intelligent were our friendly
quadrupeds, that the only whip in the cavalcade
was never used during the whole expedition
but to reprove the moral obliquities of the Professor's
horse, who took long to recover from
his jealousy.</p>

<p>It was some consolation, in riding through
the long town of Es-Salt, to find that its inhabitants
were still up. They were, in fact,
celebrating a festive occasion—the engagement,
or, perhaps, more correctly, the sale, of the
daughter of some prominent townsman. We
could learn no particulars of the transaction,
but to judge from the extreme gaiety of the
groups gathered about a flaming bonfire in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
open space, it would seem to be satisfactory to
both parties—meaning, of course, the bridegroom
and the nearest male relatives—father, uncle, and
brothers—of the bride, for she herself was not
likely to be consulted in the matter.</p>

<p>The kindly parish priests of the patriarchate,
like those at Madaba, received us with ready
hospitality; one of them even vacated his own
room for the use of the Lady when it was
ascertained that the Sisters of the Rosary, who
could more conveniently have accommodated
her, had closed their doors for the night.</p>

<p>We had time next morning to make some
small acquaintance with Es-Salt. Although it
is a town having a large fixed population
(10,000, which includes 3000 Christians) we
were struck by the anomalous fact that a large
number of the people looked like Bedu. The
men had the slender build and finer features
we had met so universally since crossing the
Jordan, and the women had the much-tattooed
faces, and even the long, trailing skirts, we had
met all over the Belka. Although it is the
seat of a kaimmakâm (governor), and has a
Turkish telegraph office, it seems to be still
in spirit, as until recently it was in fact, in
opposition to the Government. Burckhardt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
who was here nearly a century ago, speaks
warmly of the hospitality of what he calls the
"Szaltese," who were then Bedu at heart, and
even in dialect. He says their public hospitality
may be estimated at about £1000 a year,
collected from the people, and adds that were
they subject to the Turks more than that
would be extorted from them for forced entertainment.
They had lately withstood a three
months' siege by the Pasha of Damascus. Then,
as now, they were engaged in three branches
of commerce: the collection and sale for export
of sumach leaves, used largely for dyeing purposes;
the weaving of carpets from the wool
of their own flocks; and above all, the preparation
of raisins.</p>

<p>It was quite a useful enlargement of notions
to most of us to find that the familiar raisin
used in puddings is not, as the grocers spell it,
"Sultana," with some vague notion of an
Oriental association with the Sultan, but <i>Saltana</i>,
and that it comes almost entirely from Es-Salt.
The fruit used for the purpose is a
small grape without seeds. They are spread
out as soon as picked, and then turned over
and over, with fingers dipped in olive oil until
they are all impregnated in every part. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
then dried on wood ashes,—the wood employed
being the oak or terebinth—collected in baskets,
and then spread out to dry on a well-trodden
earthen floor. Two and a half kilogrammes
(a kilogramme is about two pounds and a fifth
avoirdupois) cost, on the spot, twelve piasters,
or about two shillings, less, in large quantities.</p>

<p>Another article of commerce is a very strong
tobacco known as "heesh," from the Arabic
word for the forests where it is cultivated.
It burns so badly as to have given rise to a
proverb applied to a man or a subject which
puts a stop to conversation: "It is heesh
tobacco; do not speak!"</p>

<p>A minor industry, the manufacture of rosaries,
has originated in the abundance of certain
kinds of hard wood.</p>

<p>The situation of Es-Salt is 2740 feet above
sea-level; but the town itself lies in so deep a
gorge, the mountains rising like a perpendicular
wall on either hand, that we asked
the padre whether the place were healthy, and
he pointed out that the town extended, in fact,
along two valleys—the Wady Osha, and a
narrower wady, much less airy, and consequently
less sanitary, as had been proved again and
again in times of epidemic, when cholera and influenza
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
have lingered and recurred long after
they had ceased in the town itself.</p>

<p>The water is good, and very abundant, the
town spring being the finest we had seen in
the country.</p>

<p>Es-Salt, the seat of a bishopric, was not
important till the Crusades. A fine mausoleum,
known as Sâra, is said to be of Christian origin;
and there are the remains of a church, hewn
in the rocks, with many scattered rock tombs.
The castle dates only from the thirteenth
century, when it was rebuilt after destruction
by the Mongols of the ancient fortress, which
may have withstood Saladdin.</p>

<p>We were quite sorry to take leave here
of our silent Circassian, who had always shown
himself kindly and capable, but it seemed
that his duty ended at Es-Salt—and, indeed,
his services were no longer requisite. We
noticed several Europeans in the town, probably
merchants bringing raisins for export, or possibly
grapes—for we had had some for breakfast of
very unusual quality, and what a gardener would
call "well grown," which seldom happens in this
country, where the vines are most often not
raised from the ground, so that the under
side of the bunch, though well ripened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
the warm, dry earth, is flat, and not always
well coloured.</p>

<p>Considering the amount of commerce with
other places it seemed to us to show an almost
insolent—perhaps it was only an ignorant—indifference
on the part of the inhabitants that
they should make no effort whatever to improve
the approach to Es-Salt. We left the town by a
track but little better than that by which we
had approached it—a track which would have
spoilt the business of any decent stone quarry.
The immediate exit was over a series of ash-heaps
and middens, across which the women
were trailing their long skirts with entire composure.
Next we mounted a steep ascent over
polished rock or scattered shale, just as it
happened, and then, after a short distance on
level ground, we began a long and difficult
descent into the deep gorge, which more or
less we followed all the way to the plain, that
of the Wady Shaib, now absolutely dry, but
which must be in winter, judging from the
nature of its bed, a rushing torrent, losing itself
finally in the Jordan.</p>

<p>About an hour from Es-Salt we met a boy
with a laden donkey, which we passed with
some difficulty, and a little farther observed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
spring of water and a khan. There was some
question as to whether we should meet with
any water in the only other spring upon our
route; but it was obviously too early for
luncheon, and we continued our way, passing
on a hill, to our left, a wely dedicated to Shu'aib,
diminutive of Shaib, the Arabic name (used in
the Koran) for Jethro, who gives his name to
the wady—why is not obvious.</p>

<p>About noon we reached the Ain Es-Shech,
and our horses were not slow in discovering
that water of a kind was to be had. There
was, at all events, welcome shade from a magnificent,
wide-spreading fig-tree, the branches of
which, growing close to the side of the hill,
were available as couches and resting-places
for half of its height. We boiled the water
again and again, and fished out all its most
striking disadvantages, though some were, unfortunately,
less obvious than the microbes
during a recent cholera scare at Bethlehem,
which were reported by those personally interested
in the quarantine question to be "as
large as a napoleon."</p>

<small>THE JORDAN VALLEY</small></h3>

<p class="center small">"Jordan past"</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Nothing</span>
during the rest of that day's
ride contributed so much to our entertainment
as the conduct of the white baggage-horse.
He was the pair of Sadowi, and of very similar
appearance, but had not been selected to carry
the Lady because he was, like most Arabs, and
some Arab horses, blind of one eye. It had not
at first dawned upon him that his companion
had received promotion, but the fact had been
lately revealed by some accident, and had been
working in his mind ever since. To-day things
had come to a climax, and he now perceived
that not only had Sadowi escaped from the
hateful and galling pack-saddle—in itself a preposterous
load—not only had he a much lighter
burden to carry, but he was giving himself airs
of superiority, and travelling, as a rule, the foremost
of the entire cavalcade. Such autocracy
was not to be endured, and could and should
be put a stop to; if he reigned he should not
reign alone. The creature, a worthy and excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
baggage horse, doing his duty in his
own state of life, now became self-willed and
persistent under the overmastering influence of
this dominant idea. We called him the
"majnoon," the name which the Arabs give to
the half-crazy men, generally derwishes, who
wander about, living upon the alms of the
benevolent. He insisted on keeping up with
his comrade. In spite of all inconveniences
occasioned by his imperfect sight, his clumsy
burden, he generally succeeded in remaining
side by side with, or immediately behind, the
Lady. If driven back he would persistently
push his way past all the rest in turn, till he
regained his position, loudly grunting dissatisfaction
and determination. As we descended to
the plain, and the broad caravan road allowed
room for any number to ride abreast on the
wide sands, the horse most accustomed to go
beside Sadowi made several efforts to take
up his usual position, always repulsed by the
"majnoon." Sadowi himself, who received an
occasional push from the unwieldy heap of
baggage, especially when on the blind side of
his companion, was not wholly pleased with
the arrangement; but whenever the Lady tried
to give a wider berth to her inconvenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
attendant, the "majnoon" always followed, discontentedly
grunting at the extra strain of the
additional pace he compelled himself to assume.</p>

<p>We had become, by this time, exceedingly
conscious of the change of climate, which had
occurred even since the morning, and much
more so since we left the Belka. The gorges
had been hot and close, the sands of the plain
seemed to radiate heat, and the level rays of
the sun, as we rode westward, produced towards
evening, that sense of brain fatigue indescribable
to those who do not know their
effect in an Oriental climate—to many far more
exhausting than the direct heat and glare of
midday. The moment, however, that the great
god sank to rest behind the hills of Judæa, we
luxuriated to the full in the wonderful beauty
of the brief twilight. Away to the east, almost
without our perceiving it, the purple hills arose
once more to shut out from us that enchanted
world of which we had taken one brief glimpse.
A distant flame, lurid against the pearly sky,
showed us that the charcoal-burners were still
at work. Wreaths of white mist lay in the
hollows of the mountains; while the clear mirror
of the Dead Sea, stretching far as the eye could
reach, reflected the hills of Judæa, dark masses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
looking across the wide plain to the evening
glow beyond. A single line, standing up like a
needle against the west, showed us the Russian
tower on the Mount of Olives, reminder of all
that world of politics, and rivalry, and ambition,
of which for a few days we had so gladly lost
sight. Even our old friend the jujube-tree,
<i>zizyphus</i>, was here again, reminding us that we
were once more in subtropical surroundings,
and several times we had to stoop to the horses'
necks to avoid its unwelcome embraces.</p>

<p>It was some hours since we had met with
anything human; but, as the darkness gathered,
the glare of camp fires broke out here and there,
among the bushes, and, far away, the lights of
Jericho seemed to beckon us to the repose we
were beginning to need. Suddenly we came
upon a weird scene—an assembly of the black
tents of the Bedu, a bright fire in the midst.
Quite a large number of men were gathered about
the flaming pile, some preparing supper, others
tending the animals—horses, asses, camels—tethered
beside the tents or left free to wander
in search of food among the undergrowth of
scrub. "Waiting to cross the Jordan Bridge,"
it was whispered among us, together with a
warning that we must approach this Rubicon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
as silently as possible, lest we should provoke
the jealousy and rivalry of others less fortunate
than ourselves, and cause superfluous discussion,
and delay—for even those who had fulfilled
the necessary conditions of a now practically
unlimited quarantine, might not cross the river
after sunset.</p>

<p>We rode on silently to the water's edge, and
drew rein while Khalil went forward, barefoot,
to secure the opening of the gates before we
ventured in the darkness upon the slippery and
rotten planks. There was a cautious knocking,
a long, low-toned parley. Our mukari returned,
and there was more parley among our leaders,
and a suggestion made of "a few napoleons,"
emphatically negatived by the Professor. Khalil
returned to his conference, and came back with
a request for papers. The Arabic-speaking
Sportsman, armed with a portentous sheaf of
teskerys (local passports) and permits, went
forward, soon returning, for an instant, to tell
us to get off our horses, for the poor beasts,
becoming restless, were making too much noise.
This, we felt, implied that we must be resigned
to further delay, and we stretched ourselves
upon the sand, each securely holding the tether
of his own horse, which would otherwise have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
been off in an instant in search of food; for their
supper hour was already past, and they had had
nothing since yesterday.</p>

<p>Entertainment did not fail us. In the camp
we had passed, the Bedu had finished their
supper, and were now amusing themselves about
the camp fire, which flared high, and showed
every detail more clearly than daylight. First
there was dancing and singing, both of the kind
which seems to us so singularly uninspiring—the
tunes moving over about four notes, the
dance of about, perhaps, as many steps, accompanied
by shouts and hand-clappings; men
dancing with each other, of course, or rather
opposite to each other, each occasionally resting
his hands upon his neighbour's shoulders. When
this amusement palled, each kilted his kumbaz
into his waistband as one has seen a Blue-coat
School boy dispose of his very similar garment for
precisely the same amusement, of playing—leapfrog!
With long, bronzed limbs, clean cut as
those of a race-horse, with not a superfluous
pound of flesh and not an ounce that was not
muscle, it was really exciting to see these children
of the desert vying with each other in the
familiar game, after a fashion which would be
edifying at Eton or Harrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
No; it was not amusement that lacked, it was
water! It was nearly eight hours since we had
had those precious cups of tea at Ain es-Shech,
and what we had brought away with us was,
for the most part, finished. One member of the
party, an especially thirsty soul, whose supply
had long been exhausted, looked with ever-increasing
longing at the flask of the absent
Sportsman. It was one of those admirable
aluminium flasks, covered with felt, which kept
the liquid exquisitely cool and sweet, and it had
been hanging all day at the saddle-bow, and must
now be ice cold. The very thought added to
his sufferings, as the beauty of that luscious apple
on a hot Oriental noontide may have increased
the longing of our mother Eve. "Water, water
everywhere, and not a drop to drink!" The
Jordan murmured sweetly at our feet, rippling
gently, and shining silver clear in the starlight;
but the cholera about the Lake of Galilee, whence
came that tempting stream, was a real and mortal
disease, and not the "backsheesh cholera" prevalent
elsewhere. But that flask! He knew it
to be half full—a fact which in itself showed
that the Sportsman was not in thirsty mood:
no man who knew anything of thirst—thirst such
as this—thirst which made one indifferent to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
else—would carry about with him a supply of
delicious, reviving nectar, medicine alike for body
and soul—a pint of ice-cold tea! No; it was
absolutely certain that were he here, that kindly
Sportsman, he would press the gift upon him,
insist upon his acceptance. Here in the East
are there any laws so binding, are there any
rules of honour, of generosity, so inflexible as
those which concern the question of water? The
most niggardly will give, the most selfish will
share, the most churlish will not refuse. How
long will that worthy Sportsman tarry?</p>

<p>There was a slight, a very slight, rustle in the
darkness; something moved beside that treasured
flask, truly "the cynosure of neighbouring eyes";
there was the suppressed sound of the withdrawing
of a cork, and the whole of the precious liquid
went down the throat of the younger mukari!
It was impossible to move, to speak; and if there
be any test of endurance worse than thirst it is
that, under certain circumstances, of compulsory
self-suppression!</p>

<p>After that the return of this longed-for friend
was a matter almost of indifference, and the
information he brought was but unimportant
in the presence of that mighty thirst. The
guardians of the bridge returned our papers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
which they probably could not read; they knew
nothing of the Professor's special privileges, or
considered them a mere pretext for the avoidance
of backsheesh; there was cholera in Kerak;
who was to say that we had not spent these
ten days in Kerak?—quarantine was compulsory;
no one crossed the bridge after sunset; they
were heartless, relentless, immovable, deaf to
explanation. The hasty return of some Bedu,
who had also striven to enter with a caravan
of laden asses, and who, probably having some
personal reason for travelling at this hour, would
have no conscientious scruples in offering backsheesh,
confirmed the report of the guardians'
inflexibility.</p>

<p>To pass the night, weary as we were, upon
this dry sand, beside a cool, murmuring stream,
with waving branches overhead, would be no
special hardship. The camp fires about us would
keep off the jackals, which were answering each
other's cries across the plain; we had blankets,
we had even food. Alas! however, we had no
drink, and then, our poor horses!—kind, patient
servants that they were: to-day, at the end
of, in some respects, the hardest day's work of
the whole expedition, for, although they had
done little climbing, their long twelve hours'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
steady work had been endured in burning sun
and without the refreshing breezes of the Belka.
The three baggage animals had not even had
the relief of nearly an hour's freedom from their
burdens, such as the others had enjoyed, during
the long conference. And again, for ourselves,
how were we, some of us especially, to endure
the continued thirst?</p>

<p>"Bonsoir, madame, bonsoir, messieurs! je regrette—je
vous en prie—venez prendre un peu
de café chez nous—vous reposer un peu!"</p>

<p>This messenger of mercy was a charming
young man, beautifully dressed, smiling, debonnair,
shaking hands with all of us in turn. In
a few minutes we had walked across the bridge;
the tramp behind us of our horses' feet was convincing
that it was not all a dream; in a few
minutes more we were seated about the door of
a comfortable tent, carpets were under our feet,
the Lady had an easy-chair, the men had stools;
the light of a lantern showed comfortable domesticity
within; we were drinking sherbet, we were
revived with cognac, we were refreshed with fruit,
and the preparation of coffee was in rapid progress.</p>

<p>By degrees we understood what had happened.
The wardens of the bridge, after the fashion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
subordinates "clothed in a little brief authority,"
had taken our affairs into their own hands, and
turned a deaf ear to all explanation. Somehow,
however, the matter had finally come to the ears
of the superior officer, an important functionary,
who at sunset, his duty done, had retired to his
tent at some little distance. The name of the
Professor, carried to intelligent ears, had had its
immediate effect—and here we were, relieved of
all apprehension, and luxuriously awaiting the
moonrise for the accomplishment of our journey.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the kindness of our
welcome. Our new friend presented his card to
each of us, and we in turn wrote down our names
on paper, that all might feel friendly and at home.
We discussed common acquaintances among the
Jerusalem effendis, promised exchange of visits,
sympathised as to the monotony of a solitary
existence on the banks of the Jordan, and were
interested in hearing—from a Moslem—that such
things were all very well for John the Baptist or
Elijah, but now one's ideas were different. When
conversation failed we ate nuts, almonds, delicious
salted pistachios: an Arab, even in the wilderness
of Judæa, is certain to be not far from nuts. The
spirit of hospitality was so diffused that when the
Lady was about to reject one she was unable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
crack in her fingers, the negro servant gently
took it, cracked it with his own gleaming teeth,
and returned it to her.</p>

<p>He was one of those big negroes common in
this country and known as <i>haji</i> (pilgrims), probably
because they often arrive with the Mecca
caravan, or even come on their own account to
the mosque at Jerusalem, the secondary pilgrimage
of the Moslem faith. They are employed
as guardians of property, much as, at home, we
employ watch-dogs, and may be seen everywhere,
sitting at the doors of public buildings or at the
gates of enclosed spaces. If you wish to enter
a courtyard you knock at the door, and call out
"Haj!" certain that a giant negro will appear
upon the scene. They are said to be extraordinarily
faithful, allowing themselves to be misused
and beaten rather than depart from the strict
letter of the commands they have received from
their employers. The negro in question was
clad in snow-white robes, and as he leaned up
against the door of the tent in the starlight,
absolutely motionless when not employed, the
intense blackness of his countenance showing
between his white turban and white kumbaz, it
was difficult to realise that he was of ordinary
humanity and not a picture in a fairy-tale book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
Presently the moon looked over the heights
of the mountains of Moab, just as last night she
had arisen above the Jebel Osha, and, if only
for the sake of our famishing steeds, we felt we
must not delay. Our host insisted upon sending
an escort with us, alleging the difficulty of finding
the way among those weird hills and along the
trackless sands. On being assured that our men
were competent to conduct us he still most
courteously insisted, and finally a sufficient
reason transpired which, out of kindness, he
had so far withheld. It appeared that soldiers
were secreted in the wilderness on the lookout
for criminals, of some nature not specified, who
were expected to attempt to escape by night into
the border country at the south end of the Dead
Sea, the city of refuge for the desperate and
lawless, and it was just possible we might have
some inconvenience.</p>

<p>We gratefully accepted his kindness, and took
our leave. We had already received a lesson
in hospitality, now we were to have one in deportment.
We could not but feel that our own
adieux were lacking in grace, in gratitude, in
dignity, when compared with those of our friend;
so gracious without <i>empressement</i>, so respectful
without servility—in short, so entirely all that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
most attractive in the higher-class Oriental. The
Professor, who had learned much in the school
of Bedu, alone showed to advantage, and seemed
to possess a courtesy not wholly graceless and
European.</p>

<p>Our next lesson was in horsemanship. Our
escorting soldier was as nearly ubiquitous as it
was in the nature of man and horse to be. A
distant caravan of camels showed sharp against
the sky. He had flashed up to them, interrogated
them, and was back, beating up our rear, and
again in front, indicating the track we were to
pursue; for Khalil had abandoned responsibility,
and was frankly asleep on the top of a pile of
baggage. Even the "majnoon" had wearily
desisted from his ambitions, and had retired to
the rear with his humbler companions.</p>

<p>If that strange world had seemed weird and
visionary in the morning twilight, it was even
more so under the moon, where the silent sand
cities cast long shadows of a blackness so intense
as to be comparable only to those of electric light.
Indeed, this Oriental moonlight has nothing of
that quality of softness—the half-revealing, half-concealing
gleams, to which we are accustomed
in the West. It is hard, clear, metallic. It
is a peculiarity, perhaps, of this Syrian atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
that outlines appear so sharp that they lose,
apparently, in solidity; in what artists call "the
round," so that the distant view of Jerusalem, for
example, has the effect of stage scenery, of an
absolute lack of perspective, which makes it extraordinarily
difficult to compare distances. Tonight,
for instance, when a vista between the
sand hills allowed us to perceive the village of
Jericho, it seemed inconceivable that we should
not reach it in a few minutes, and yet it was
already after eleven o'clock before the splash of
our horses' feet in the water, told us that we
were crossing the brook Cherith.</p>

<p>At this point our soldier disappeared, flashed
out of sight—his kind intention, as we soon found,
being to arouse the haj, the solitary occupant of
the hotel, and apprise him of our arrival. We
had not to wait long before the gates were opened
and the barking of the dogs exchanged for a
kindly welcome. They were old friends, degenerate
descendants of some far-away mastiff,
and still more distant collie, who had made
<i>mésalliances</i> with some son or daughter of the
soil, and left traces of another race, much as
we trace the Crusader in the blue eyes and fair
hair, of which specimens remain, here and there,
in almost every village in Syria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
There was naturally no fire, and dreams of
tea were destined to disappointment; but there
were other combinations obtainable where water
was good and abundant, from which we were
not averse. Have we not, some of us, drunk
"Ben Nevis" on Mount Lebanon and "Talisker"
in glens other than those of Skye? We had food
with us, though our friends' hospitalities had left
us little appetite, and we made no complaint—having
water and towels—that sheets were not
forthcoming. All that lacked, in this semi-tropical
atmosphere, was a sweet-scented breeze from off
the Belka.</p>

<p>We rose somewhat sadly next morning, and
compared our twilight start with that of nine
days ago—sad, not as so often happens, from
any consciousness of anticipations unfulfilled, of
hopes disappointed, but only because those
golden days were now buried with the past.</p>

<p>We rested for some time at the Good Samaritan
Inn, and wrote some picture postcards, to be
stamped—strange anachronism—with the postmark
<i>Bon Samaritain</i>! Perhaps twopence was
a large sum in New Testament days, or it may
be that good man had a long bill when he "came
again"; or, still more likely, the progress of
civilisation and of religion has relegated hospitality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
and trustworthiness to the ignorant and
savage Bedu. Anyway, the shilling demanded
seemed to us a good deal to pay for a cup of
tea and a biscuit.</p>

<p>We had no further adventure, and stopped but
once, to photograph the stone which Abraham
brought on his back from some distant place—variously
stated as Hebron and Damascus. Whoever
shall place his back under that stone will
be reinforced for carrying his own especial burden.
We looked back now with a sense of familiar
friendship at those grey hills, which had so lately
been among the limitations of life, with a realisation
of widened knowledge and added sympathies,
which, on our return to the commonplace burdens
of every day, should move us to thankfulness
and not to regret. Each evening now the sunset
glow would seem to smile to us from the faces of
old friends, telling of a country beyond—fairer,
purer, it may be, than ours, but in its friendships,
its loves, its presentation of the beautiful, not
very different from this.</p>

<p>We reached home in time for luncheon, and
it is fair to record that the "majnoon," grunting
and breathless, was in at the death.</p>

who have undertaken the education
of the tourist have instilled into him,
among other irresponsible statements, the superstition
that one can travel in the Holy Land
only during the three spring months of the year,
thus leaving the far more agreeable season from
September to March for the delectation of the
serious student. This conviction, and the absence
from our party of pith helmets, white
umbrellas, hats invested with floating veils,
blue spectacles, superfluous luggage, broken-kneed horses,
dragomans, and other impediments
to comfort and convenience, made possible the
unsportsmanlike start which otherwise might have
caused a careless observer to mistake us for the
"Personally Conducted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
To drive in a carriage as far as El Bireh,
sending our horses in advance, was however a
venial sin; for the ride to Nablûs was before us,
the first three or four hours being along a
highroad of very moderate interest; and, at
best, we could not hope to get in before nightfall,
in spite of our start at six o'clock on a
December morning.</p>

<p>We were a very attenuated party—only the
Lady and the Doctor remaining of our former
group. We were reinforced, however, by the
Artist, a lady whose saddle-bags were weighty
with cameras and sketching-blocks; and by
another learned doctor, who, on account of his
association with a celebrated guide-book, we
designated "Baedeker." Sitting in a carriage
is not inspiriting, and even the sight of the
Holy City in the sunrise, viewed from Mount
Scopas, as purple in the morning as it is pink
in the evening, failed to arouse our conversational
powers. The tribe of Benjamin welcomed
us coldly on the broad plain assigned to it, and
we could think only with some dejection, of the
bygone days when this plucky little people
could afford to lose twenty-five thousand men in
a single battle (Judges xx.), and when the six
hundred who held out on yonder hill of Ramah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
repudiated by all their neighbours, possessed
themselves of wives in the good old Sabine
fashion, and made a fresh start in their frontier
colony. Fifteen Moslem families now inherit
the traditions of former glory; and, indeed, the
population hereabouts is very thinly scattered.
It is whispered that some of the villages have
so evil a reputation that the neighbouring
districts now, as two or three thousand years
ago, are wont to say: "There shall not any
of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to
wife"—the women already established there not
being desirable associates for those otherwise
brought up.</p>

<p>At El Bireh our vehicle drew up in front of
the khan or village inn, where there is a good
deal of accommodation for horses, and a single
small room for man. There we breakfasted,
while our steeds were collected and our saddle-bags
dispersed. We had no baggage-horses,
and had all our personal belongings, as well
as fodder for the beasts, to distribute as best
we could, so that we were unable to accede to
the characteristically Oriental request of a Greek
priest that we would relieve him and his horse
of a part of their burden. We had been at El
Bireh before, and so did not linger to see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
ruins of the very fine Church and Hospice of
the Knights of St John, which testify to its
former renown. The church, which is of the
same ground-plan as that of St Anne at Jerusalem
and that of St Cleophas at Qoubeibeh
(probably Emmaus), had three naves, terminating
in a triapsidal chancel. It was rebuilt by the
Crusaders, who had here a fortress and stronghold.
The tradition which it commemorates, is
that it was here, a day's journey from Jerusalem,
that the child Jesus was missed by His parents,
who returned to seek Him. There is also a
further tradition that it was here that, seated
under a palm-tree, the prophetess Deborah
judged Israel. The palm-trees remain, with
many other signs of the fertility produced by
the presence of an excellent spring.</p>

<p>No horses were visible, although we were
assured that they had left Jerusalem at two
o'clock—a statement we ventured to doubt when
they were at length produced, still perspiring,
and obviously over-driven. The Arab has little
idea of time, and, indeed, Khalil's sense of
veracity never permits him to make a promise
more definite than: <i>Iumkin inshallah</i>—"Perhaps,
if God will"; and his idea of futurity is limited
to <i>bookra</i> or <i>ba'ad bookra</i>—literally, "to-morrow,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
or "after to-morrow," but used as equivalent
to "by-and-bye," near or remote. The Arab
has no compunction in keeping you waiting;
but is equally indifferent to losing time himself,
and cheerfully sits down on your doorstep
until you are ready to give him attention.
"Baedeker," much experienced, had carefully
selected his own saddle and bridle, sound ones,
the pride of their owner, who had naturally reserved
them for the decoration of his stables,
and had sent the usual aggregation of unrelated
straps, patched leather, and rotten string. Our
friend had a fluent command of Arabic and
some half-dozen other languages, and he expressed
his views on the manners and customs
of the country at considerable length to Abdallah,
who was no further moved than to ejaculate: <i>Ana
baraf? Allah baraf</i>—"Do I know? God knows"
when his patron's breath was exhausted, and
to pass the palm of his left hand over the back
of his right, the palm of his right over the back
of his left, in testimony of his personal innocence
and irresponsibility.</p>

<p>The Lady was, of course, faithful to her old
friend Sadowi; but the horses all knew the
Nablûs road, and, having no desire to better
their acquaintance, professed disinclination in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
various forms. Somewhere about 1900 it was
decided to make a road between the capitals
of Judæa and Samaria—Jerusalem and Nablûs—and
all the beasts of both towns are well aware
of the undertaking, which has been finished
only as far as El Bireh, the remainder, some
nine hours' journey, being in various stages of
that incompleteness which is so infinitely more
discouraging than no road at all. As, however,
we could see for some miles ahead of us what
bore the aspect of a <i>Sultaniyeh</i>, the Turkish
equivalent for the king's highway, some of us
weakly proposed to take the carriage farther.
This, however, we found impossible, as the road
at present is only to be looked at—a wise provision,
as we later discovered.</p>

<p>At Beitin, about half-an-hour farther, we
passed from the territory of Benjamin to that
of Ephraim, from Judæa into Samaria, from
the arid and treeless Jerusalem district into the
verdure, the colour, the obviously greater prosperity
which one finds anywhere else. Surely
every traveller who permits himself to think,
unfettered by conventionality and tradition, must
continually ask himself why the Jewish people
should have taken for their capital a site which,
however "beautiful for situation," was, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
point of view of milk and honey, of vineyards
and olive-yards, of corn and wine, inferior to
almost any other in Palestine; where water
must always have been scarce, and the hillsides
bare, though, undoubtedly, less arid and
desolate than now; where the winter winds
and the summer siroccos were more pitiless
than anywhere else; where the soil was
shallow, and the season of possible cultivation
short. So long as one is in the Holy City,
under the spell of its influences, of its associations,
sacred and profane, its interests,
literary and archæological, its Babel of tongues,
its cosmopolitan population, its immigrants
from every corner of the world, so long as
one hears the music of its place-names, as
one feels the enchantment of its moonlight,
sunlight, starlight, of its colouring, of its life—so
long is one prepared to echo the vauntings
of the Psalmist and the prophets; but one has
only to visit almost any other spot in Palestine
to ask, from the point of view of common-sense
and the practical, why Joshua did not settle in
Shechem, or David in his native town of
Bethlehem; why Abraham was not satisfied with
Hebron, or Solomon with the plain of Sharon;
or here at Beitin, assuming it to be Bethel, why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
Samuel did not remain permanently, instead of
returning from his annual visits to his shelterless
home, perched on the arid hilltop, north-west of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages Bethel was located farther
north, near Nablûs, but later historians identify
it with Beitin. It is a miserable village, with
only the remains of a crusading church—said to
be on the site of Jacob's vision, now a mosque—to
recall past prosperity; but there is abundance
of water, and everything was looking green and
fresh after the early rains. The associations,
Jacob's dream, the burial of Rebecca's nurse,
Jeroboam's golden calf, Elisha's bears, seemed
to diminish in historical perspective when we
heard of a circle of stones of probable religious
significance and extreme antiquity, and very rare,
west of the Jordan; but time would not permit
us to examine them. There is a fine reservoir,
300 by 200 feet, which has a spring in the
middle; and all about were scattered hewn stones
and remains of columns, which one is free to fancy
may have belonged, as is said, to the temple
of the golden calf. A little beyond lie the
pleasant little villages of Jifna and Bir es Zet,
occupied by Christians, with churches belonging
to both Greek and Latin Catholics, some English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
missionaries, and a school supported by the
American Quakers of Ramallah, about an hour
away, who, here and elsewhere, have excellent
institutions of a really useful and practical kind.</p>

<p>Ruins on various hilltops remind us that the
district was of importance in Roman times, that
Jifna was the capital of one of the ten toparchies
into which the Romans divided Judæa, and that,
probably on account of its importance as the
great north road, several points of vantage were
fortified by the Crusaders—a stronghold known
as Casale Saint Giles, after Count Raymond of
Saint Giles, having its special significance for the
English.</p>

<p>The Lady was particularly interested in a hill
lying to the south, as being associated with a
piece of folklore of which a close variant is
found in the Outer Hebrides. An inhabitant of
Jifna, returning home from fulfilling his Passover
obligations in Jerusalem, was recounting the
wonders which had lately taken place in the Holy
City—the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth.
His friends were quite disposed to believe in
the miracles of healing related, but when he
concluded with the account of the Resurrection
his wife, who was plucking a fowl for supper,
observed: "Your story is just as probable as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
this cock should fly out of my hands and escape";
upon which the bird returned to life, and, flying
through the door of the house, alighted upon
the opposite hill, which is called <i>Jebel ed deek</i>—Hill
of the Cock—to this day (<i>cf.</i> Goodrich-Freer
"Outer Isles," Chap. x.). According to some, the
village of Et-tayyibeh, which fronted us as we
left Beitin, is "the city called Ephraim," where
Jesus retired after the miracle of the raising
of Lazarus, so that something of His fame
was, perhaps, already known in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Truly, the tribe of Ephraim had a beautiful
inheritance! All the way we go are signs of
a rich abundance such as our eyes are little
accustomed to; fig-trees, whose wide-spreading
branches sweep the ground; olive-trees, whereof
the young shoots, the biblical "olive branches,"
have grown into veritable individual trees, and
each hoary veteran stands king in a little grove
of his own kindred. In a narrow valley, where
there is only just room for the new road above
the bed of what must be at times a torrent, we
noticed many Jewish tombs cut into the rocks
on our left, and stopped to examine one, of more
elaborate workmanship than the others, having
the seven-branched candlestick sharply cut into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
the rock to the left of the entrance, three pairs
of branches turning upward and four downward.</p>

<p>Two of the party turned aside to visit the
village of Seilun, lying about half-an-hour east
of the road—a scene of manifold interest. The
view alone is worth the détour, affording the
first glimpse of Hermon, the great landmark of
Palestine and Syria—a chain extending for about
twenty miles, and averaging over 9000 feet in
height. The identification of Seilun with Shiloh,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
at once brings to the mind a crowd of associations—the
resting-place, from the time of Joshua
to that of Solomon, of the Ark of the Covenant;
the scene of the prayer of Hannah, and of the
dedication of Samuel; of the life and tragic death
of Eli; of the visit, in disguise, of the wife of
Jeroboam.</p>

<p>Nothing is more tiresome than the conventionality
which obliges a tourist, at sight of a
bat or an owl, to recall some quotation or apply
a prophecy, as if bats and owls were never found
unannounced by the minor prophets; but the utter
desolation of Seilun, ruined even in the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
St Jerome, can hardly fail to remind the spectator
of the words in Jeremiah, although we do not
know the nature of the catastrophe referred to:
"Go ye now unto My place which was in Shiloh,
where I set My name at the first, and see what
I did to it for the wickedness of My people
Israel." The mound is covered with débris of
buildings, hewn stones, broken columns, and
fragments of carving. One of the more complete
among the ruins is evidently built of fragments
from some earlier structure, the lintel of
the door, now fallen, being a monolith covered
with beautiful sculpture. The main building, a
mediæval fortress church, is some 33 feet square,
the roof having been supported by four columns
with Corinthian capitals. A small mosque has
been added on the east side at some later period,
and is known as <i>Jâmi' el Arba' in</i>—the forty
companions of the Prophet. These forty saints
turn up in various forms in Palestine—Jewish,
Christian, and Moslem; and at Ramleh
(Arimathea, probably) the same tower has done
service in honour both of the forty Christian
martyrs and of the forty companions of the
Prophet. An exceedingly realistic picture in
the Armenian cathedral at Jerusalem supplies
full details of the martyrdom. Upon Mount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
Carmel we have a sacred grove known as "the
trees of the forty" (<i>i.e.</i> martyrs), and near
Nablûs we passed a chapel known as Rijal el-'Amud—"Men
of the Columns"—the burial-place
of forty Jewish prophets. The new road came
to an end at the thirty-fifth kilometre, just after
the separation of our party. It had passed
through various stages illustrative of the history
of road-making, and had lately been reduced to
the merest anatomy, wholly destitute of covering.
It now reverted to the piles of rocks which,
under the name of roads, are to be so carefully
avoided in the East—at best resembling the
bed of a mountain torrent, but more often the
wreck of a Yorkshire wall. The riders naturally
made their way across the nearest ploughed
fields, and finally, by a precipitous descent, found
themselves in the small plain or wide valley of
the Lubban, where a busy scene presented itself.
In a corner of the triangular plain, or at the
mouth of the valley, as one prefers to regard it,
an abundant spring takes its rise beside the ruins
of an ancient khan, and here large numbers of
fellahin and Bedu had paused to water their
cattle, horses, and camels. Here our party
reunited once more, and here we lunched, to
the great amusement of a large audience, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
were particularly entertained with our spirit-lamps.
A testimony to the greater fertility of
this district was afforded by the immense flocks
of birds passing over our heads eastwards, probably
to the newly-sown fields, and by the rooks
following the plough.</p>

<p>It was after three o'clock before we were
again on our way, and the twilight soon overtook
us, although we did our best to push on,
warned of a very bad descent before we should
reach the great plain framed by the hills of
Samaria. Just below this descent, and before
coming into the Plain of El-Makhna, we met
the other end of the new road coming out from
Nablûs to meet that from Jerusalem. We avoided
it with much care, grateful to the whiteness of
its newly-macadamised surface for warning us,
in the darkness, where not to go. For something
like three hours the great hills of Ebal
and Gerizim loomed vast before us; while far
away we knew the great snow crown of Hermon
must be looking down upon us; but we had little
pleasure in our ride, for the darkness had already
descended, and from lack of interest we were
all tired. Even the Arab servants, Khalil
and Abdallah, did not talk, and only from time
to time broke out into song. So many persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
of all kinds must traverse this road from
Jerusalem to Nablûs, and so few but tourists
must trouble themselves to carry tents, that
one wonders someone does not establish a
decent khan to serve as half-way house in the
twelve or thirteen hours' ride—though it might
be difficult to say where, as the Christian
villages of Bir es Zet and Jifna occur too early
in the day's march from Jerusalem. However,
when the new road is once opened, some of
the neighbouring villages, El Lubban, for instance,
may send out feelers in the direction of the
highway of commerce.</p>

<p>The stars, of a brightness of which we know
nothing in the West, came out suddenly, as if
a curtain had been withdrawn, not piercing the
darkness one by one, as with us; and soon a
radiant moon looked over the top of the great
screen of mountains on our left; and when,
by-and-bye, we turned, somewhat suddenly,
west, we had sufficient light to be conscious
of the great hills of Ebal and Gerizim on
either hand, and to catch a glimpse of the
enclosure around Joseph's Tomb and, a little
farther on, Jacob's Well. Our horses, who had
been dejected and uninterested all day, seemed
to be aware that the worst was over, and, suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
reviving, were soon clattering over the
cobble-stones of Nablûs. At every turn we
expected to be stopped by a demand for our
teskerys (passports), or some other formality,
as in no town in Palestine is the traveller so
subject to demands for backsheesh as here, and
it was with some surprise, as well as relief,
that we found ourselves in the spacious reception-room
of the convent. By a kindly
provision of the patriarchate in Jerusalem, here
and at certain other places, one can obtain very
comfortable sleeping accommodation and the
means of preparing food.</p>

One can hardly feel doubt as to the identification, the biblical
description being so very exact: "Shiloh, which is on the north
side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from
Bethel to Shechem [<i>i.e.</i> Nablûs] and on the south of Lebonah
[<i>i.e.</i> Lubban]."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

<small>TO SAMARIA</small></h3>

<div class="quotes">

 <p>"What these rites [<i>i.e.</i> of the Samaritans] are, I could not
 certainly learn, but that their religion consists in the adoration of a
 calf, as the Jews give out, seems to have more of spite than of truth
 in it."—<span class="smcap">Henry Maundrell</span>, 1697</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">We</span>
rose early next morning, in order to
view the sights of Nablûs, and returned
in a couple of hours, in entire sympathy with
the desire of the Jews to have no dealings with
the Samaritans—not that we found the Jews
themselves particularly attractive, for they are
here of that type of feature, so rarely seen in
the East, which we habitually associate with a
Cockney accent.</p>

<p>The town lies in a long, narrow streak between
Ebal and Gerizim, the sole pass in the central
mountain range of Palestine, the farthest north
of the line of cities—Shechem, Shiloh, Bethel,
Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and Hebron—long commercially
important, and, from the abundance
of water and surrounding fertility, capable of
becoming what it perhaps once was—a really
beautiful city. It contains the ruins of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
churches, now all converted into mosques; one,
known as the Great Mosque, having been
originally built by Justinian, and restored in
1167 by the canons of the Holy Sepulchre
of Jerusalem, with much resemblance to their
own church. Another mosque of interest,
probably originally a hospital of the Templars,
is now devoted to the lepers, who here present
a miserable spectacle, practically uncared for,
in striking contrast to all that is done for
them in Jerusalem, where there are two lepers'
homes—one supported by the Government, and
nursed by the Sœurs de Charité; the other, and
larger, by the German Moravians.</p>

<p>From the aspect of the Jewish and Samaritan
inhabitants one may gather that the soap produced
in fifteen factories is mainly an article of
export. The Moslem population, which amounts
to over 20,000, is more prosperous in appearance;
and, indeed, Nablûs is a somewhat thriving
centre of trade in wool and cotton. There are
about 700 Christians, mainly of the Greek
Church. The Franciscans, as well as the Jerusalem
patriarchate, have churches and schools;
and there is a small Protestant community, now
in the hands of the C.M.S., originally founded, on
very different lines, by Bowen, afterwards Bishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
of Sierra Leone, who was a practical philanthropist
and who established looms, gave technical
instruction in various arts, instilled cleanliness
and sanitation, and taught his flock to earn an
honest living; after which, by degrees, and having
spent himself and his substance, he gave them
religious instruction. The Moslems have a girls'
school and college, and several elementary schools.</p>

<p>We picked our way to the Jewish quarter
through heaps of decaying vegetable matter and
along roofed passages, dark as a cellar, and where
only in the middle could one walk upright, into
the Samaritan settlement, which was decidedly
cleaner and more airy, but where the inhabitants,
spoilt by the tourists, were clamorous for backsheesh.
At every step we were tormented by
would-be vendors of antiques, mainly cufic coins,
the very school children bringing torn pages from
their copy-books for sale to the Frenjy who
were known, by experience, to be ready to buy,
irrespective of the value of the articles of commerce.
As a matter of fact, we did buy, from a
member of the high priest's family, an Arabic
seal, a silver medal of some Roman Catholic
community, and some models of the rolls of the
Law ingeniously made out of kerosene tins!
What Palestine did before Russia and Asia Minor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
sent her kerosene in cubical tins, known as "gas-boxes,"
it is difficult to imagine—not on account of
the "gas," which is, however, cheap and good, but
on account of the tins, which are, in their natural
state, the water-cans, flower-boxes, general receptacles,
and even wine and spirit barrels, for
every household. With slight additions and a
little manipulation they become garden watering-pans,
dust-pans, sieves, culinary vessels of various
kinds, lamps, lamp-shades, reflectors, stoves,
baths, musical instruments, spoons, forks, and
brush handles. They serve the errand-boys for
baskets, and the children for toys; they supply
material for buildings, from a dog-kennel or
stable up to an entire suburb of Jerusalem, known
as the Box Colony—the houses, constructed out of
miscellaneous materials, being entirely faced with
"gas-tins"; they are raw material for the tinsmith,
the gunsmith, and, in some degree, for the
leather trade, as we found traces of them in our
harness. And here, in Nablûs, they turned up
afresh, effectively modelled into the likeness of
some of the oldest bookbinding in the world.</p>

<p>We found ourselves, finally, in a small square
or court inhabited by the Samaritan community,
where climbing a few stairs, we reached a sort
of balcony, in which a score of children were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
receiving instruction, their feet tucked up in front
of them, their shoes piled together in the doorway.
We followed two good-looking young
men into a small, whitewashed room, the floor
of which was covered with matting, and which
contained, for all furniture, a sort of reading-stand,
upon which were placed, for our inspection,
the scrolls of the Law. Of course, we did not see
the famous Samaritan Codex—who does?—but that
exhibited was of sufficiently venerable appearance
to appeal to our imagination, and, in a certain
sense, to our reverence. It was soiled and worn,
in the part exposed, from the frequent handling
and kissing of many generations; and the elaborate,
gilt cylinders, so often portrayed, might be, for all
we knew, of considerable antiquity, although Sir
George Grove, who described then nearly fifty
years ago, concluded, after careful and expert examination,
that the oldest could not claim to be
earlier that the fifteenth century. Even had we
been privileged to see the celebrated Codex itself
we should not have believed that it was written by
Abisha, the son of Phinehas, nor even—the alternative
tradition—by Manasseh, the high priest
in the time of Ezra. The Samaritans keep all
the Jewish festivals, but sacrifice only at the
Passover. They ignore all the traditional literature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
and teach only the Pentateuch, and, according
to many travellers' tales, and even a popular
guide-book, the "Book of Joshua," which, however,
is not a sacred volume but a mediæval MS.,
written in Arabic, with proper names in Samaritan,
and describing the adventures of their race from
Moses to Alexander. This, with a few prayers
and hymns, constitutes all their literature.</p>

<p>No one can feel indifferent to this little community,
"sent to Coventry" some two thousand
five hundred years ago, when the Jews refused
to allow them to share in the rebuilding of the
Temple on the ground that they were mere
colonists, destitute of genealogy, and that no one
knew who they were, or where they came from.
No wonder that the Samaritans, under the circumstances,
should have set up rival Holy Places,
like the Greeks and Latins, respectively, in
Jerusalem to-day. Here they are still, however,
on the same spot; while the Jews, who despised
them as a mushroom population, are wanderers
over the face of the earth. They are said to be
decreasing in numbers, and amount now to only
about one hundred and sixty. Benjamin of Tudela
estimated them in the twelfth century as only
one hundred in Nablûs; but in those days they had
adherents in Ascalon, Cæsarea, and Damascus—amounting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
to one thousand in all. Now, this is
their only settlement; the little, whitewashed
synagogue the sole outward and visible sign
of their race, their faith, and even their dialect,
for in the ordinary affairs of life they use
Arabic.</p>

<p>The office of high priest is hereditary in the
tribe of Levi, and it is interesting to note
that he holds, in addition, the secular dignity of
president of the community, and is, moreover,
one of the district authorities. Jerusalem has
some personal acquaintance with his son and heir-apparent,
who makes occasional visits to the
Holy City for various purposes, including the
sale of manuscripts, not, perhaps, quite convincing
as to their antiquity or value; but the scion of a
high priest must live, even if the methods should
bring him occasionally within the arm of the
Law. The official stipend is derived from tithes
paid by the faithful, who, unfortunately, have
little to tithe.</p>

<p>Their festivals have been often described; and
the Samaritan Passover has become a commonplace
of tourists, though, happily, there are still
some to whom the slaughter and disembowelling
of half-a-dozen poor little lambs, which have been
tamed and kept as domestic pets, is not a pleasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
sight at close quarters. One feels especially
thankful for the Gospel dispensation on reading
in the twentieth century such details as the
following:—"Whilst the six lambs were thus lying
together, with their blood streaming from them,
and in their last convulsive struggles, the young
<i>shochetim</i> (five lads, who acted as butchers) dipped
their fingers in the blood, and marked a spot on
the foreheads and noses of the children. The
same was done to some of the females."</p>

<p>Importunate Jews and Samaritans followed
us back to the convent, their numbers increased
by inquisitive Moslems coming to see the Frenjys
fleeced, and a few especially impudent girls, who
demanded backsheesh on the ground that they
"sat down in the English school." We speedily
convinced the entire crowd that we were not
tourists, much to the satisfaction of the officers
of the convent, who suffer much from the visitors
of their guests.</p>

<p>"Baedeker" was on business, and we were
obliged to postpone, to some future occasion,
several visits we would have gladly paid; above
all, the ascent of Mount Ebal, whence one has
a view practically over the whole of Palestine—a
country, be it remembered, however, containing
no more square miles than that of Wales.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
Gerizim is, historically, the more famous of the
two, and that most frequented, as by far the easier
climb; but a view from Carmel to Jaffa, from
the Mediterranean to the mountains of Moab,
would have been to some of us more suggestive,
and of deeper significance, than the Moslem
wely alleged to contain the skull of St John
the Baptist, or even the church, possibly of
the Justinian period, which may be on the site of
the Temple of Gerizim destroyed by Hyrcanus,
rival to that at Jerusalem. At Jacob's Well also
we would have willingly lingered, grateful to
Professor G. A. Smith for leaving us still in
possession of the traditional site, which he
maintains against many opponents. ("Historical
Geography," xviii.) Another site offered for consideration,
as that where Abraham prepared for
the sacrifice of Isaac, we summarily condemned
without trial. Some of us had ridden to Beersheba,
which we knew to be a good sixteen hours'
ride south of Jerusalem, Nablûs being equally
a good twelve hours' north, and we failed to
understand how an old man and a boy, with an
ass heavily burdened, could have made the
journey on foot in a period of less than three
days! The acoustical properties of the valley
between the two mountains need astonish no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
one who has seen the position, or indeed many
other places in Palestine, where the nature of
the limestone formation, the innumerable caves,
and the intense clearness of the atmosphere,
carry sound to inconceivable distances, and many
times we have carried on conversation with
persons visible only as a distant speck. On one
occasion the Lady, who had left the Artist
sketching on some rising ground, and had herself
crossed a valley, and climbed a Tell beyond,
mindful, though somewhat incredulous, of traditions
on the subject, addressed her friend, whose
whereabouts she knew, but who otherwise was
too distant to be easily visible. To her intense
surprise she was promptly answered, and the
two were able to carry on conversation without
even raising the voice.</p>

<p>We were soon on our way north, anxious to
have time to visit Sebaste, the city of Samaria,
on our way to Jenin, our next halting-place for
the night. The scenery of this district, if pleasing,
is as unexciting as the county of Yorkshire.
There are bare spaces, rocky and sterile, sloping
down into fertile plains. There are pleasant
fields and fruitful gardens, and we gathered our
first anemones of the season, scarlet and purple
and white, and noted that the mandrakes were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
coming into bloom—rich, compact masses of
violet in their crumpled, primrose-like leaves.
Here and there were trickling rills, which,
although the season was dry and the early
rains had been a disappointment, had enough
life left in them to produce bright ribbons of
verdure across the plains, which opened out
amid detached hills to right and left. Not only
the familiar olive-trees scattered over wide tracts
of land, but oaks and carobs, and even gardens
of fruit-trees—apricots, pears, apples—give to
the scenery a homelike air, which to our eyes,
long used to the sepias and vandyke-browns of
Judæa, was reposeful and refreshing.</p>

<p>We were able to appreciate the observation of
Professor G. A. Smith (<i>op. cit.</i> Chap. xvi.), that
Samaria is the scene of all the long drives of
Old Testament history—a fact due to the openness
of the country, and the possibility of
practicable roads passing among, rather than
over, the mountains. It was here that Ahab
raced the rain-storm coming up from the
Mediterranean—well do we know the tearing,
raging "latter rains" of Palestine; here that
Jehu drove furiously; here that Naaman came
with his horses and with his chariot to visit
Elisha; here that Jehu gave a lift to Jehonadab,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
the son of Rechab; here that Ahab, who had
at least the virtue of courage, was propped up
to lead the battle while his life-blood streamed
into the midst of his chariot, to be licked by
the dogs when it was washed in the pool at
Sebaste, whither we were hastening in the morning
sunshine.</p>

<p>We passed through two or three villages, each
with its gardens and springs, and noted the
beauty of the women—a rare sight here, where
a woman is a grandmother before thirty and a
withered hag at thirty-five. They are more
graceful, more shapely of limb, with better-set
heads than in Judæa, where a woman's comeliness
is measured by weight, especially among the
so-called beauties of Bethlehem. We turned
out of a well-wooded valley into a wide basin,
where a rounded hill, some 300 feet high, rose
suddenly in front of us, like an island in a lake,
which, in days when it was crowned with a
stately city of Greek architecture, and surrounded
at the base by a noble colonnade nearly 2000
yards in length, must have been, indeed, an
imposing spectacle.</p>

<p>Few spots in the whole of Palestine are possessed
of associations more varied and interesting
than those of Sebaste, though its history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
may be less familiar than that of other cities.
Always strategically important, protected by
mountains on three sides, looking clear out to
the Mediterranean on the fourth, one cannot
wonder that Omri should have recognised its
value as a stronghold; nor that it should have
withstood several prolonged sieges, one lasting
until one mother said to another: "Give thy
son that we may eat him to-day, and we will
eat my son to-morrow," and till an ass's head
was sold for fourscore shekels. It must have
been down below, in the plain across which we
are riding, that a curiously dramatic scene was
enacted when the lepers, obliged, even in times
of siege, to sit in the gate, argued among themselves
that they might as well die by the hand
of the enemy, with a chance of food, as sit where
they were, with the certainty of starvation—and
so ventured into the camp of the Syrians, to
find that an aural hallucination of the sound of
horses and chariots had caused their flight, so
that the poor pariahs "went into one tent, and
did eat and drink, and carried thence silver and
gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
came again, and entered into another tent,
and carried thence also, and went and hid it."
Even the Assyrians blockaded Samaria for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
three years before they could possess it.
Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Lagos, John
Hyrcanus—each in turn invested this little
hill rising before us, so green and smiling in
the midday sunshine, always an enviable possession.
Picture after picture rose before our
minds as we rode across the fertile plain, but
none more vivid than that of the days of its
Greek grace, its Roman luxury, as interpreted
by Herod, who named it Sebaste—Greek for
Augusta—in honour of his patron, Augustus, who
had bestowed upon him the site of the city
demolished by Hyrcanus over a century before,
though to some degree restored by Gabinius,
the successor of Pompey.</p>

<p>Herod it was, who raised the colonnades and
gateways which we were approaching; who built
a city, according to Josephus, two miles and a
half in circumference; who beautified it with
palace and theatre and hippodrome; who made
it a recruiting centre whence his veterans could
collect mercenary troops; who substituted the
worship of Cæsar for the worship of Baal, in a
temple, whereof the ruins lie a few score yards
beyond those of the great Gothic cathedral of
the Crusaders, now turned into a mosque—the
site having been originally chosen as that of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
basilica, in honour of the tradition that the body
of St John the Baptist was here buried, a tradition
dating, at least, from St Jerome. The
tombs of Obadiah and Elisha are also shown in
the same rock-hewn chamber.</p>

<p>Well might Isaiah call such a spot "The
pride of Ephraim, the flower of his glorious
beauty, which is on the head of the fat
valley!" and when, in addition to all the gifts
of Nature, we add all that wealth and art could
command, we cannot help reflecting, as on a
score of occasions during our journey, here and
in Moab, upon the persistent fashion in which
history and fact are falsified by conventionality.
The literature and art of a thousand years, the
teaching of one's childhood, the wilful misapprehension
of modern travellers, the conventional
treatment of works of devotion, have combined
to impress a great number of sincere and devout
persons with the general idea that the surroundings
of our Lord somewhat resembled those of a
Highland fishing village; whereas—in Jerusalem,
in Jericho, along the shores of Gennesaret, in
Tyre and Sidon, in Cæsarea Philippi, in the
cities of the Decapolis, and here in Sebaste—His
eyes must have rested upon architecture and
sculpture which, even in decay and ruin, are still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
a revelation of beauty to such as ourselves,
accustomed to the ineffectiveness of the Thames
Embankment and the trivialities of Trafalgar
Square. Here in this little country of Palestine,
two thousand years ago, were palaces and fortresses,
theatres and hippodromes, temples, baths,
colonnades, porticos, triumphal arches, forums, to
which Europe, in this twentieth century, with all
her boasted science, her educated "masses," her
"art for the million," is at least wise enough to
attempt no rivalry. In a Bedawin tent we may
recreate the life of the patriarchs, and realise that
Abraham was but a wealthy shech; in many
a fellah village we may find such kings as
the thirty-two who reinforced Benhadad; we
may find everywhere types of half the characters,
of most of the manners and customs, of the New
or Old Testaments. The everlasting hills remain;
the stars, as the sand of the sea, still shine
out in millions, which in the West the ordinary
observer can never look upon; the flowers
spring up for us as for Solomon; the patient
beasts are but intermittently remembered now
as in Holy Writ; the dog is still the victim and
not the friend of man; the sheep follow their
shepherd—at his voice they separate from the
goats; the poor are always with us—but only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
strong effort of imagination, only familiarity with
traditions of classic art and luxury, can revive
for us the glory of the cities, "over whose acres
walked those blessed feet."</p>

<p>On this subject at least may we here enlarge
our notions, and "divest our mind of cant!" May
we realise something of the glory of the Temptation-vision
of our Lord, something of the æsthetic
beauty over which He, beholding, wept; may
imagine somewhat of the stones and the buildings
which were there; may conceive the contrast
between the cave-stable of Bethlehem and
Herodium, the castle of the Herods, which
frowned down upon the Jewish village; between
the little group which surrounded the Master
when He paused to heal the blind beggars of
Jericho, and the sensuous beauty of the city,
with its subtropical vegetation, and its luxurious
winter homes.</p>

<p>Even Jerash, more perfect in its remains, impressed
us less than Sebaste, so unique as to
beauty and dignity of position. The mosque,
although rich in fragments of what must have
been a grand cathedral in the days when Sebaste
was a bishopric—the title is still owned by the
Greek Church—has been too recently restored,
after destruction by fire, to be very interesting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
Our attention was, in fact, somewhat diverted
by some handsome Arab boys playing unmitigated
hockey within the precincts. On the north
sides are the outlines of a square fortress, with
corner towers, probably a home of the knights
of St John. Mutilated remains of the Maltese
cross are still to be traced on many of the stones
scattered about Sebaste. M. de Vogüe, who
seems to have been the first to show, in plan, a
restoration of the buildings, considers that, next
to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, this was
the most important reconstruction of crusading
times. The length is almost 165 feet, the breadth
75. The decoration of the capitals is of the
beautiful palm pattern, the arches of the apse
are pointed.</p>

<p>"Baedeker," to whom all this was already
familiar, proceeded with the horses to the top
of the hill to superintend the servants' preparation
for luncheon, as time was precious. We found
him, half-an-hour later, sitting in the midst of
a group of shechs—young men, women, and
children hovering in the background. With their
usual absorbent interest in politics—the greater
for the rarity of its gratification—they had
assembled to hear the latest news, and had
worked backwards from the new railway and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
troubles in Macedonia—which had called into
service Arab soldiery from all parts of Palestine,
and had been the excuse for special taxation—to
the Boer War, the Armenian question, and
the visit to Palestine of the German Emperor,—the
great epoch of the modern history of
Syria—the occasion of new buildings, new roads,
new uniforms, new trade, and a general cleaning-up
along the line of route, with which only
the orders issued during the cholera scare of
1903 could in any degree be compared.</p>

<p>With the usual courtesy of the Moslem
Oriental, so different from the unabashed curiosity
of Europeans and the Europeanised, they withdrew
when we made preparations for food, the
two or three actually engaged in conversation
too important to interrupt, emphasising the
occasion for discretion, by throwing stones at
others who approached too closely. Some
children, many of singular beauty, retired behind
a neighbouring wall, and for some time lacked
courage to pick up the dainties we threw to them.
When we made our final move numbers came
up to offer coins, fragments of carving and
specimens of carnelian, lapis-lazuli, and crystal.
One especial treasure was an abominable bracelet,
of the type of art sold at exhibitions, and lost—to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
her advantage—by some tourist—not, fortunately,
that many tourists visit Sebaste, as was
shown by the superior manners of the people
and the absence of demand for backsheesh. The
village is entirely Moslem, and all behaved with
self-respecting dignity, if we except, perhaps, one
boy who pulled gently at the Doctor's blond
locks, to see if they grew upon his head; and
some men who, greatly interested in our spirit-lamps,
put a match to the weeds upon which we
emptied one before packing, with a childish
pleasure in, as he said, "setting fire to water."
One of the many cheap conveniences of this
country is the fact that one gets an imperial pint
of spirits of wine—no miserable "methylated"
substitute—for about eightpence; but we have
never found it in a Moslem village, where the
use of alcohol is, of course, forbidden by religion.
With much hesitation and politeness some of
the men asked leave to examine a small revolver
belonging to one of the party, which excited
great admiration, the firearms of the country
places being often of a very primitive description,
sometimes of such a size that one wonders how
they are carried. It is very rare, however, to
meet an Arab, beyond the towns, who is not fully
armed, even if his weapon be a flintlock six feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
in length. It was a curious conjunction of the
new and the old, when Khalil stopped a shepherd
one day to ask for a light for his cigarette, a
dainty Egyptian, which we had given him. The
peasant produced a piece of a table-knife, picked
up a flint off the roadside, tore a scrap of blue
cotton from his ragged garment, and in an instant
Khalil was made happy as only tobacco in any
form could make him.</p>

<p>A self-constituted guide dispersed the crowd,
and conducted us round the hill, that we might
more closely observe the colonnade, some 20
yards wide, and originally over 1800 yards long.
All the columns have lost their capitals and
architraves, but are still 16 feet high, some being
monoliths. Besides, perhaps, over a hundred
still standing, columns and fragments of columns
are scattered in all directions—a lesson in the
history of Tells and the exaltation of the valleys
of Palestine. Many were still on the surface of
the ground, still more were half buried, of others
only the projecting stones of the base remained
visible; while here and there the observant, or
rather, perhaps, the experienced, eye, could
perceive by the contour of the ground that
hidden treasure of sculpture lay concealed. The
soil is deep, and, for the most part, cultivated;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
for the hill of Sebaste is no rocky scarp, and
in ten years much of all this will have disappeared.
A separate mound, a little away to the
west, is said by some to be the site of Ahab's
ivory palace, and might repay exploration.
Happily, the Germans seem able to obtain firmans
at will, having probably inspired confidence,
even in a suspicious Government, by the
liberality and thoroughness of their excavations.</p>

<p>We longed to linger among so much that was
beautiful both in art and nature—the green hill
sloping gently to the wooded plain, the hills eight
miles away opening towards the west, where the
intensely blue waters of the Mediterranean,
though distant a score of miles, sparkled gaily
in the sunshine. Little wonder that the sun-worshipping
peoples should have here erected
temples to the great god, whose majesty was
shown to them in the smile of the sea and the
glory of the sunset! Little wonder that the great
Syrian princess, Jezebel, should have rejoiced in
the ivory palace looking across to the northern
shore she had known in her childhood's home.</p>

<p>One parts so reluctantly from what is beautiful
that some of us resented almost angrily a reminder
that it was possibly at yonder gateway
that the dogs licked up the blood of Ahab; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
on this smiling plain Jezebel slew the prophets
of Jehovah; and Jehu, with still greater brutality,
the priests of Baal and the family of the king;
that here also Herod murdered Mariamne,
strangled his sons, and, possibly, beheaded John
the Baptist.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Our last visit was to the hippodrome, lying in
a bay of the hill to the north-east—a fine natural
position for such a purpose (480 by 60 yards).
Many fragments of columns yet remain, apparently
belonging to this noble circus, but which
some have alleged to belong to a second colonnade
at right angles to the first, such as we saw
at Jerash. Finally, as we descended to the
bottom of the valley to the north-east, we passed
another plateau, strewn with massive columns,
but a few of which remain upright, probably the
forum of the Herodian city, and noted here and
there some fine sarcophagi. A ride of four and
a half hours was still before us, some of which
was over paths of a nature to be traversed, if
possible, by daylight, and we might not linger.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_2" id="Foot_2" href="#Ref_2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another tradition, more probable, though with less dramatic
fitness, places the scene of the execution at Machærus, east of the
Dead Sea.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<small>TO TAANAK AND MEGIDDO</small></h3>

<div class="quotes">

 <p>"Consider with me that the individual existence is a rope which
 stretches from the infinite to the infinite, and has no end, and no
 commencement, neither is it capable of being broken. This rope, passing
 as it does through all places, suffers strange accidents."</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">For</span>
the first fifty minutes our road lay, for
the most part, upward, constantly offering
glorious views, especially in retrospect, and then,
after crossing a green and wooded plateau, we
began once more to descend to the north-east,
and at the village of Jeba, after passing through
a pleasant district, well covered with fruit gardens,
found ourselves, about an hour later, once more
on the ordinary highroad from Nablûs to Jenin.
We looked with interest at the village of Sânûr,
with its ruined fortress, monument to "Some
village Hampden that with dauntless breast The
petty tyrant of his fields withstood," some eighty
years ago. The petty tyrant was the Pasha of
Acre, who besieged, and with difficulty captured,
the fortress manned by the independent villagers,
whose courage must have impressed the authorities,
for they had the cowardice to destroy the fortification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
entirely. A little farther on we rode across
a low plain which resembled the bed of a large
lake, perfect in islands and peninsulas, and
which bore the descriptive name of the Meadow
of Sinking In—<i>Merj-el-Gharak</i>. Fortunately for
us it was fairly dry, and we were able to press
forward over its green surface, urged on by
"Baedeker," who assured us of two bad descents
which would be trying to the nerves and, what
mattered more, the riding powers of the Artist,
who was somewhat inexperienced in horsemanship,
and, on the theory that December was a
cold month, so encumbered with clothing that
she had no seat whatever, and who having been
unwillingly persuaded to emulate the Lady's habit
of riding <i>en cavalier</i> courageously faced difficulties
by standing in her stirrups and balancing
herself upon the pommels. Of course, the stirrup
straps broke at frequent intervals, not having
adapted themselves to their new uses; but the
accident was soon repaired, and the interval of
repose was good for the horse, happily as gentle
as a sheep, but who suffered also from the unwonted
arrangement</p>

<p>Fortunately, nothing more serious occurred to
detain us as we resisted the temptation to turn
aside to inspect Dôtân, probably the Dothan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
where poor little Joseph, after passing through
Shechem, fell into the hands of the Midianites,
who carried him into Egypt. Nablûs, as we have
seen, being the only pass through the mountain
range of Central Palestine, and Samaria being
an open country of good roads, this district must
have been the great highway from north to
south, from the coast to the Jordan, from Europe
and Asia to Africa. It is easy enough to imagine
the caravan of Midianites winding southward
along yonder ridge, laden with spices for embalming,
and visible from far by the sons of
Jacob as they sat about the well at the foot of
the hill, now crowned with terebinths, and well
aware that the travellers would probably turn
aside for water. Many ancient, empty, bell-shaped
cisterns are to be found in this district
such as that into which Joseph was let down.</p>

<p>We surmounted a stony ridge, where the path
was in such good condition (not being slippery,
as we had feared, after the early rains) as to
give us confidence in regard to the worse which
was to come, but which, in fact, turned out to
be all the better for such dampness as there
was, as the horses were less liable to slip on the
polished rocks; and, indeed, these creatures are
as surefooted as donkeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
We were glad that the daylight sufficed to
show us, as we descended into a narrow valley,
before reaching the village of Kubâtîyeh, a
sacred tree adorned with rags, standing by the
wayside on our right—the first we had seen on
our journey, though we afterwards met with
many, especially in Galilee.</p>

<p>Such trees exist all over the country, both east
and west of the Jordan, except where the presence
of Europeans has taught the people to disguise
their beliefs, which even then, however, appear
in other forms; as, for example, in Jerusalem,
where the faithful tie rags to the framework of
windows in the mosque and elsewhere, instead
of, as here, in the Temple of Nature. The
theory of such veneration seems to be much
the same as that of the Old Testament saints,
who left stones at Bethel, and Ebenezer, on the
banks of the Jordan, and so on, "which remain
there," say the chroniclers, "to this day"—evidently
indicating that they are a monument
to record, a witness to testify, an outward and
visible sign to excite inquiry, to serve as evidence
of some special visit, to demonstrate to
God and man that such an one was there in
person, from such and such motives, and with
such and such intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
The tree itself, with its quaint decorations,
torn from the apparel of the faithful, is not
always the direct object of veneration. It is
often accompanied by a wely or grave of a
saint, and though at times the cause of the
selection of such a place of interment, is sometimes
only the accidental consequence, having
grown up beside the tomb; whence it is held
to be under the saint's protection, just as other
objects—ploughs, timber, grain, and vessels of
various kinds—are left there, safe from thieves,
Christian or Moslem. Sometimes such a wely
is surrounded by a whole grove of trees, which
may be sacred for either reason, and may be the
cause or effect of the presence of the saint. We
always behold them with satisfaction, as assuring
the continuance of vegetation here and there,
which would otherwise, at least in Judæa, inevitably
be destroyed.</p>

<p>Another use of such a spot is for the cure
of diseases. This may be by means of self-suggestion,
the disease being transferred to the
tree with the fragment of the dress of the patient,
making much the same demands upon the imagination
as the Christian science, the hypnotic suggestion,
the bread-pill, of modern therapeutics.
Another method of cure—also a question of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
dominance of mind over matter—is that of taking
from the tree the morsels attached to it, which
are then worn like the scapulars from Lourdes or
St Winifred's, just as, long ago, the sick carried
from St Paul "handkerchiefs or aprons, and the
diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits
went out." Truly, there is nothing new under the
sun! Often, especially on Thursdays, the eve of
the Moslem Sabbath, these trees have been seen
in flames, which, however, do them no injury,
just as Moses saw "the bush which burned and
was not consumed." Sometimes voices speak in
them, just as David waited for "the sound of the
going in the mulberry-trees." Sometimes they
are held sacred as having served as resting-place
for some holy man, just as the oak of Abraham
at Hebron is, as such, still a place of pilgrimage
for Christian, Moslem, and Jew.</p>

<p>We could ascertain nothing concerning the
history of the sacred tree of Kubâtîyeh; and,
indeed, it is but rarely that the people are able to
relate the history of their shrines, although their
faith in them must be strong, as it suffices, as we
have seen, for the protection of articles deposited
there for safe-keeping. Men—Christians or
Moslems—ready to swear anything by the
Almighty, will hesitate at a false oath by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
shrine of a saint. In some places they hang fragments
of meat upon the trees, just as the Israelites
offered "shewbread," and Jotham talked of "the
wine which cheereth God," the anthropomorphic
conception of the Deity being nearly as strong
now as when the Israelites were still wanderers
in the desert. Such ideas are racial rather than
religious. Professor Curtiss ("Primitive Semitic
Religion To-Day") demonstrates effectively that
such beliefs are common to Christians and
Moslems and, in places, even to Jews; he mentions,
however, one shrine at least which, on
account of the more than doubtful character of its
orgies, the more fastidious Moslems have abandoned
to those of other creeds. Still, as in the
time of Hosea, "they sacrifice upon the tops of
mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under
oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the
shadow thereof is good." The shadow, by the
way, has a direct effect of healing upon the
really sick, but is dangerous for the <i>malade
imaginaire</i>. We would commend it to the
attention of fashionable physicians.</p>

<p>The discussion of sacred shrines and trees lasted
us during our long and steep descent to the
bottom of the valley, where the sight of the
telegraph wires recalled us to the realities of life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
and it was with great satisfaction that we found
ourselves farther descending, through a Moslem
cemetery, into the town of Jenin. Here, as elsewhere,
we noticed the entire absence of the outskirts
and suburbs to which one is used in a
different civilisation. One enters directly into
a city or village without any intervention of
scattered domesticity to indicate what is coming.
We were at once in the main street, substantial
houses two storeys high on either side of us; here
a large <i>serai</i> (court-house), there a gaily-lighted
coffee-house thronged with guests; gardens and
palm-trees among the houses; obvious well-being
everywhere. We stopped at the village khan,
and were at once conducted to our resting-place.</p>

<p>In old schoolroom days, when we used to read
the long lists of places the Israelites conquered or
did not conquer, we little thought that one day
we should take an active and personal interest
even in the order of their arrangement. Issachar,
we learn in Joshua xix., had assigned to them
sixteen cities, which included En-gannim and
Tabor, "and the outgoings of their borders to
Jordan," and here, for the first time in our lives,
we were not bored by Issachar, and were
delighted to be at En-gannim, which is Jenin,
and means "the garden spring"—a fact impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
upon us as we were ushered between long garden
borders, hardy herbaceous of aspect, overshadowed
by rose-bushes, into two delightful little stone
summer-houses at the bottom, with a fountain—now,
alas! dry—between. The men took possession
of one house, the ladies of the other, and in
the latter, as the larger and pleasanter, we prepared
our supper. There were mats on the
floor, some stools, two chairs, a table with a
patchwork cover, and three of the deep window-seats
which, in the East, are generally large
enough to count as fittings. A clay stove, with
glowing charcoal, was prepared for us outside the
door, plenty of water was placed at our service,
and we were soon feasting on soup, tinned meats,
preserves, white bread, and, of course, tea. At
intervals servants came across from the khan to
attend to our needs; and finally all was cleared
away, and comfortable mattresses, pillows, and
wadded quilts, all in freshly-washed covers, were
spread upon the floor. It may be worth while to
mention, once for all, that, despite the presence
in our little company of some supersensitive
souls, we never had occasion to unpack our
precious "Keating."</p>

<p>To awake in a rose garden on a December
morning, to go out of doors to wash, to take our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
breakfast at an open door, are sensations to
remember. Khalil was late in bringing the
horses, ordered for seven o'clock, and so sleepy
that we more than suspected he had assisted at
the <i>fantasia</i>, the sounds of which had reached us
far into the night. He was, however, less inclined
than usual to resent having to stay behind the
rest of the party, in order to lead the Artist's horse,
at the pace which alone was possible under the
circumstances. It probably gave him the opportunity
of a good nap.</p>

<p>Jenin is surrounded by gardens, and dominated
by palms and minarets. It is a seat of government,
has a bazaar, and two Moslem schools.
One of its mosques may have been the church
which was seen by Boniface of Ragusa, a
Franciscan writer, as late as 1555, erected to
commemorate an early tradition that this was
the scene of the healing of the ten lepers, one of
whom was a Samaritan—a fact, however, which,
by the light of nature, one would not expect to
be specially mentioned in Samaria.</p>

<p>Passing over a little stream, and among cactus
hedges, we soon left the ordinary route northward
on our right, not only from our usual desire to
avoid the beaten track, but because it was to
be our special privilege, under the leadership of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
"Baedeker," to visit two spots practically unknown
to ordinary travel—Taanak and Megiddo—at
both of which very extensive excavations are
in progress, the one under Austrian, the other
under German auspices. Very soon after leaving
Jenin we had made a still farther descent, and
found ourselves at the entrance of the plain of
Esdraelon or Jezreel, the greatest in Palestine,
which, roughly speaking, extends from the
Mediterranean to the Jordan, although interrupted
by certain undulations. Esdraelon, the
great battlefield of the country, was commanded
by a strategical line of fortresses, Taanak,
Megiddo, Bethshan, and Dor, the first three of
which we hoped to visit.</p>

<p>Our road was, for the most part, just such as one
finds in the neighbourhood of an English agricultural
village—a well-trodden path between
cultivated lands—where, however, among corn
already springing green, crocuses, white, yellow,
and purple, pink cranes' bills, and yellow daisies,
the weeds of Galilee, turned the whole into the
aspect of a garden. Plovers wheeled overhead,
rooks followed the ploughs, dainty chats watched
us but a few feet away, chiff-chaffs and corn-crakes
and starlings and sparrows and skylarks talked
English, and only when we passed a sacred tree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
hung with rags, or the eye was caught by the
colocynth fruit, or by anemones, scarlet, purple,
or white, were we reminded that this was Galilee
and December, but that, being some two hundred
and fifty feet below sea-level, we had no right to
feel surprised at hot sunshine and the flora of
spring.</p>

<p>The plain widens as we advance, and as here
and there some distant spot is pointed out upon
the wide horizon, our hearts thrill at the mention
of names of lifelong familiarity, glorious in association
of the past, but which we realise with
difficulty as being before us here and now. Behind
us are the hills of Samaria, to our left the
country slopes gradually upward into the low hill
of <i>Belad-er-Ruah</i> (the Breezyland), the wall which
separates the plains of Esdraelon and Sharon,
hiding the Mediterranean, and ending, far ahead,
in the great precipice of Carmel, where we know
the blue waters are lapping gently this soft, warm
morning. To our right are the hills of Gilboa;
while farther, where peninsulas of mountain step
out into the plain, we are bidden to look here
and there; while the name of Nain, Endor, and,
above all, Nazareth, bring before our minds
pictures imagined in childhood, and which it may
be difficult, though not unwelcome, to supplant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
The great round island of Mount Tabor serves
as centre from which to calculate the whereabouts
of this place and that.</p>

<p>Our party had been reinforced by the addition
of a practical excavator whose presence was
specially valuable to us, not only for his knowledge
of the country, but because he had done
active work on both of the Tells we were about
to visit. We commonly called him "the Italian,"
although he spoke Italian, German, French, and
Arabic with equal facility, and, having been
associated with the abandoned English railway,
was even capable, at need, of falling back upon
English.</p>

<p>At the end of two and a quarter hours we drew
up at the foot of Tell Taanak. No one who has
even seen a Tell could fail to recognise another
wherever he met it, and no one who has not seen
one would be quite easily convinced of its nature.
In Europe, where, if we destroy a house, we
use the material for something else, where we
reckon in centuries where the East reckons in
cycles, where smoke and damp and frost, to
say nothing of utilitarianism, are for ever laying
waste, it is difficult to conceive of a city abandoned
thousands of years ago, and buried, by the hand
of Time, as gently as the Babes in the Wood by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
the robin-redbreast. Imagine the city of York
(to take as an example one which stands upon a
plain) forsaken of its inhabitants, gently dropping
to pieces as it stands, and, finally, neatly covered
up, in the course of ages, in a grave-shaped
mound, leaving plenty of room for the cathedral
towers, and grown over with flowers and grass;
then suppose that a party of New Zealanders,
visitors to Harrogate, about the fortieth century,
should make a vertical shaft straight through the
middle, and, somewhat disdainful of vestiges so
modern as the county capital, should work their
way down to Eboracum, and (but here the
analogy of the English town ceases) to two or
three cities below that. The specialty of the
methods of the German excavators is that specimens
of all that is met with are, if by any means
possible, preserved as the investigation proceeds,
so that you may reconstruct for yourself the life of
York, as well as of Eboracum, and of any Scandinavian
or British predecessors below both.</p>

<p>The contrary method, of destroying one city
to arrive at another, and hastily covering up what
remains of both, has however, certain advantages,
as it enables excavators to dogmatise without
possibility of contradiction from succeeding archæologists,
and so saves much of that discussion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
which, while it establishes knowledge and elicits
facts, is a weariness to the amateur public of subscribers
and contributors. The German (and, of
course, Austrian) excavations are conducted by
groups of savants, and not by individuals. Each
has his own specialty; and as there are several of
such groups now at work in Palestine each, at need,
can be reinforced from elsewhere; results can be
considered from various standpoints, and opinions
exchanged. No <i>ad interim</i> reports are presented
to the public; the excavators are not obliged to
have something to say at stated intervals; and
when the results finally appear they are in a form
which leaves nothing to be desired from the point
of view of art production. Teutonic thoroughness
frugality, and self-dedication can never be
more admirably exhibited than in the prosecution
of knowledge in this form; and the German
expenditure, as compared with the result, is, in
Palestine, as surprising in scientific research, as
in their philanthropic institutions.</p>

<p>We rode as far as a terrace more than half way
up, and then dismounting were soon absorbed in
the excavation, on our own account, of a rubbish
heap close by, where we filled our pockets with
fragments of painted pottery and iridescent glass,
with jar handles and broken lamps. "That is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
Cypriote," "that Phœnician," "that pre-Amoritic,"
"that merely Arabic," pronounced our experts.
"Merely Arabic" might be earlier than the
foundation of Westminster Abbey, or the days
of Charlemagne, but we were willing to hold it
cheap when we could have for the stooping, let us
say, the fragment of a water-bottle, still fresh as to
its ornamentation, pleasing as to its colouring,
which had long been buried when the nomadic
tribes of the Israelites first settled in Canaan; or
a lamp which may have burned when "fought the
kings of Canaan in Taanak by the waters of
Megiddo"—celebrated in the savage war-song of
Deborah the prophetess, which, in its geographical
allusions, is a mine of wealth to the archæologist.</p>

<p>Exploring a Tell must be wonderfully exciting
work, even when one has rewards less immediate
than the results at Taanak, which is the first
Canaanite site ever excavated. Think of finding
oneself face to face with the remains of the infants
offered up on yonder rock-cut altar—jars
and jars full of the bones of poor little Canaanitish
babies who might otherwise have lived to play
with the little Manassehites who came to settle
among them, whose fathers could not drive out
the people of Taanak from their own stronghold.
Or imagine the sensation of finding, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
metres deep under the soil, the only Israelitish
altar of incense ever discovered! Although
broken into forty pieces, Dr Sellin contrived to
put it together, when it was found to be exactly
in accordance with the prescribed Mosaic measurements,
decorated with rams' horns, with carvings
of six cherubs and four lions, and with representations
of the Tree of Life and the struggle of a
man with the serpent. Dr Sellin ascribes it to
the period when the Samaritan influence was
strong in Israelitish worship, and thinks it may
be as late as from five hundred to one hundred
years before Christ. It is to be observed, however,
that the German specialists hesitate to claim
the very remote periods assigned by other
excavators to similar discoveries, often differing
from them by as much as a thousand years.</p>

<p>Here we came across the massive wall of a
Canaanitish building of a period some eighteen
hundred years before Christ; there what was
possibly the house of Baana, the governor of the
fortress in the time of Solomon; here an Arabian
castle of the times of Haroun-er-Raschid; here
was found an image of Baal, there of Astarte,
here a head of Jahwe, the god of whom it was
forbidden to make any graven image. The
variety of the commercial relations of Taanak is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
shown by Mykenæan pottery from the Ægean,
scarabs from Egypt, seal cylinders from Babylon.
Four thousand years at least passed in review
before us as we clambered among the ruins; we
ran down an inclined plane into a city which was
ancient when the child Joseph passed under its
walls, a trembling little slave, on his way down
from Dothan into Egypt; or, perching on a staircase,
looked into the homes of those citizens whom
Joshua failed to subdue. Here we mount a few
steps, and find ourselves in the fortress which
guarded the plain when Israel and Sisera were
struggling on the banks of the Kishon; or, wandering
outside, we rest beneath the city walls</p>

</div>

<p>No story of the Arabian Nights which may
have been related here could have for us half the
glamour, the enchantment, of those we may make
for ourselves here and now. A fragment of
iridescent glass, of an ivory handle, of a water-jar—here
are charms enough to weave the magic
spell! And here, to exorcise all, comes the rain,
and we find ourselves again amid the petty cares
of to-day, and hasten back to the terrace where
our horses are patiently waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
We were quite ready to accept the alleged
Megiddo as such, on the authority, among others,
of Robinson among older geographers, and of
Professor G. A. Smith among the new, and, perhaps
still more, of those who had turned the site,
as well as the question, inside out.</p>

<p>Tell el-Mutesellim lies just beyond Lejjun,
which corresponds with the Legio of Eusebius.
The great plain is called by St Jerome by the
name of Campus Legionis, as well as the plain
of Megiddo. "The waters of Megiddo," of which
we read in Judges, are represented by the
abundant streams, tributaries of the Kishon,
which the Arabs call the Muquṭṭa. At Lejjun
one at once observes a very fine aqueduct, and
a large mill, both Roman, and some tentative
excavation, which promises good results later, has
revealed a theatre and some bricks stamped with
the cognisance of the sixth legion. Megiddo and
Taanak are always named together in Bible
history, and we learn that both were fortified
towns before the Israelitish occupation; that the
tribe of Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants;
that Solomon fortified Megiddo; and
that two kings of Judah—Ahaziah and Josiah—died
there, far from their own royal city—a fact
which testifies to its continued consequence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
Excavation at Tell el-Mutesellim has revealed
a strongly-fortified city of obvious importance,
which seems to fulfil all required conditions.
Conder, however, identifies Megiddo with a
distant town near the Jordan, far from Taanak,
the Kishon, and the great plain, which there was
no particular reason for fortifying, but which
is called Mujedda, which sounds rather like
Megiddo.</p>

<p>We reached Lejjun in bright sunshine about
an hour after leaving Taanak, and Tell el-Mutesellim
rises somewhat abruptly beyond. On an
intervening hill, separated from the Tell by a
narrow valley, stands a row of corrugated-iron
huts, neatly lined with wood, surmounted by the
German flag, and bearing the familiar legend,
"Thames Iron Works," another reminder that
the abandoned English railway, making such
rapid progress but a few miles away, must
henceforth be put to the credit of Turkish
finance and German perseverance.</p>

<p>One large hut served as reception-room, and
later as bedroom for the ladies, a second as
storeroom and bedroom for the men, and a third
was divided into stable, kitchen, and sleeping-place
for the servants. A drawing-room was
arranged for us in the open air, where deck-chairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
were placed so as to be sheltered by huts on both
sides, with a glorious view over the Tell beyond
to Carmel, Tabor, and the mountains of Gilboa;
while the fertile plain stretched like a great sea
all around, and behind us we could look over
Lejjun, in the near distance, to our old friends
the hills east of the Jordan.</p>

<p>"Baedeker" and the Italian had been greeted
by half the inhabitants of the district, all old
friends and co-workers in the excavation of the
Tell, glad just now of a vacation, which gave them
leisure to cultivate their fields, but quite ready
to return to the work promised them in a few
weeks. We met a man with a gun, who had
wandered far, in vain, in search of game for our
table, and another who mourned that only a
couple of eggs had been forthcoming when our
somewhat sudden arrival was announced; but the
cook, <i>pro tem</i>, was in good spirits at having at
an early hour secured five chickens, which had
been simmering ever since. One of the Arab's
many virtues is that his soups are strong and
he never gives you underdone meat. If this
were true at lunch it was still more so at dinner,
after seven hours' additional cooking, and the
liberal allowance of material, all served in the
same <i>pot-à-feu</i>, gave everyone the chance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
select his favourite portion. The Italian, who
had made a shorter journey than we, had brought
us some extra luxuries, and we found ourselves
in very comfortable quarters.</p>

<p>After luncheon we visited the Tell, and, with
plenty of time before us, enjoyed a detailed inspection,
and the opportunity of pausing, wherever
we felt disposed, for discussion and examination.
The amount of excavation already accomplished
was just enough, like the index of an interesting
book, to indicate what might be expected, and
to rouse, without exhausting, our interest. Here
we were shown what seemed an extraordinary
extent of surface excavated in proportion to the
short period—about four months—of work.
"Baedeker" had himself had charge of the work,
with the Italian as foreman, and so we were able
to follow in detail the plan of operation, and to
learn how to dissect a Tell. They had begun at
the eastern edge because, as it was the highest
point, they expected to find an acropolis, as was,
in fact, the case. The city to which it belonged
had, apparently, been destroyed by fire, as the
great beams which served as supports were considerably
charred. The fortress, of Jewish workmanship,
was built of great stones, but the
buttresses were of brick. There was an outer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
wall, and an aqueduct of later, but also of Jewish,
construction.</p>

<p>We were even more interested in a temple of
pagan cult, where, not in the open air, as usual,
but inside a square chamber, were found a rock-cut
altar, and on either side a mazeba, or stone
pillar, such as Solomon set up before the Temple,
with the names of Jachin and Boaz, and such as,
under the name of menhirs, we find in Scotland
and the west of England, and, in fact, all over
the world—relics of a cult associated with the
most elementary principles of nature worship. In
horribly suggestive proximity were sacrificial jars
containing the bones of infants, head downwards.</p>

<p>South of the walls of the fort were many small
rooms, possibly barracks; while a tomb near was
crowded with the bodies of men, and in another
tomb were found ten skulls, of which many
showed cuts or holes, evidently relics of a siege.
One incomplete shaft, but a few feet wide and
seventeen metres deep, not yet reaching rock,
showed us the method of beginning operations.
Here we could see sections of a wall of unburnt
brick, and of two others of unhewn stone, and
we longed to return to see these indications
followed up. Among the most precious portable
finds were an idol and a terra-cotta head, probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
Egyptian, a seal with letters in an unknown
script, a bowl for libations, a painted censer, and
several enamelled gods. Shortly before our
arrival, during the last days of work before
pausing for the winter rains, some large tombs
had been opened, and found to contain some
beautiful and unique painted jars, as well as
other jars, bowls, and lamps in large quantities.
No description of these excavations had as yet
been published, and we thought ourselves very
fortunate in being able to study and inquire at
first hand. It is almost equally interesting to
listen to an explanation of work accomplished,
and to speculate as to the results of work only
begun.</p>

<p>After dinner we were tempted by the notion
of visiting these cities of the dead by moonlight,
and were well repaid for the effort of crossing
the rough ground of the intervening valley.
There were no sensuous triumphs of Greek or
Roman art, no glories of column and capital,
but, perhaps still more impressive, the homes
of peoples who had passed away when Greece
and Rome were yet unborn. Here were streets
trodden by men of like passions with ourselves:
hastening to business or pleasure, meeting their
brides or burying their dead. Here were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
chambers in which the drama of life had been
played out over and over again—comedy as
well as tragedy, birth and death; here the altars
where vows had been fulfilled and the gods
propitiated; gardens sanctified by the games of
children, the laughter of youth; where ambitions,
hopes, affections had been born—to die, or to
live for ever. All around us spoke of the eternity
of all but man—the stars, the hills, the flowers
which return to us year by year—Carmel outliving
its tragedies, Tabor its miracles; beyond
the hills that ancient river, the River Kishon,
hastening to the eternal sea. Man alone had
passed away, leaving only the wreck of his labour,
the ruin of his homes, to show where he had
been. But yet another thought came to us. In
a fold of yonder hills, where the moonlight rested
tenderly, lay the little village of Nazareth, where
long ago there dwelt a Man who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="small">

<div class="verse indent20">"Wrought</div>
<div class="verse">With human hands the creed of creeds</div>
<div class="verse">In loveliness of perfect deeds,</div>
<div class="verse">More strong than all poetic thought."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We carried our discussion no further. Surely
here, as in that little village, had been men into
whose lives had entered the beautiful and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
true—which, in proportion as they resembled the
life of that Man of Nazareth, must endure for
ever.</p>

<p>It was the last night of the old year, and in
each heart were memories and longings which
might not be revealed. We walked back through
the soft night air, each thinking of friends far
away, gathered about winter fires, and speculating,
perhaps, as to the whereabouts of their wanderers.
When we had once more assembled in our
friendly hut, and, thanks to "Baedeker's" kindly
forethought, had drunk together of an excellent
punch of tea and red wine, with a dash of
kirsch-wasser, we felt constrained to go forth
once more into the wide space beyond. Not
a solitary light twinkled on the hillside;
the village of Lejjun was sleeping: we were
the centre of our world. The horses were
tethered before our doors, and we were
amused to observe that the force of habit
persisted even in sleep, and that, so used
were they to travelling <i>en queue</i> that, even
in repose, they stood in a single row, head
to tail.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<small>HAIFA AND CARMEL</small></h3>

<div class="quotes">

 <p>"Traversing this fertile country one is more and more impressed with
 the incorrectness of the judgment of the ordinary tourist who,
 confining himself to the route prescribed by Cook, is taken through the
 barren hills of Judæa and to one or two holy places in Galilee, and
 then goes home and talks about the waste and desolation of
 Palestine."—<span class="smcap">Laurence Oliphant</span></p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">The</span>
early hours of the next morning were
devoted to sketching and photography,
and after a midday lunch we mounted for
a ride, of some nine hours, to Haifa. We soon
found ourselves back in the plain, with the great
precipice of Carmel before us for our goal. The
general features of the country were the same
as yesterday, except that we had the River Kishon
for our companion. Even the slight amount of
rain which had fallen had had its effect here,
and the road in parts was heavy enough to
disconcert the horses, who picked their way as
daintily as if they remembered nothing of the
fact that it had rained, with considerable mud as
a result, even in their own royal city of Jerusalem,
only nine months ago. We could not wonder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
however, that the River Kishon should have
swept away the hosts of Sisera, for on ground
such as this the horse-hoofs might well be
"broken by means of the prancings," and nine
hundred chariots of iron, hemmed in between
the river and the steep hillside, would have a
very poor chance, especially in the rainy season,
which one may imagine it to have been, as Jael,
whom one thinks of as of the Medici, or the
knitting-women of the Fronde, "brought forth
butter in a lordly dish"; and butter, except at
a prohibitive price, at a convent or two in
Jerusalem, is not to be had in the summer
months. Surely so vile a woman was never
celebrated in song!</p>

<p>The flowers were an endless feast; never
had we seen anemones of so many shades, and
perhaps the greatest event of the day was the
finding of the first jonquils, <i>narcissus tazetta</i>.
We had been watching their deep green homes
for the last three days, but this was the first
time we had been rewarded. Both the Doctors
contrived to possess themselves, upon an island
in the river, although with some difficulty, of
a great handful of the sweet-smelling blooms,
the firstlings of our New Year's Day. A few
minutes later we came to a couple of bridges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
one for the railway and one for the road, and
from that point we were more or less in sight
of the railway all the time. Some of the horses
made a great fuss about the passing of a train,
for, although the line is not yet formally open
for passenger traffic, a train runs every day in
each direction for the convenience of the
engineers. Just at sunset, after about eight
hours' travelling, we came in view of the lights
of Haifa, twinkling along the shore, with only
the palms and minarets to dispel the illusion
that it might be Brighton or Hastings. Carmel
was before us, the great landmark of the Palestine
coast, boldly leaping out into the sea, its lighthouse
throwing out a friendly welcome, rather,
perhaps, than a warning, to those who go down
to the sea in ships. This is the one spot on all
the Syrian coast remotely resembling a harbour;
elsewhere are only ledges for sea-birds, rocks
inviting to wreckage, and Nile sand brought up
by the currents flowing north. The Phœnicians,
of whom alone among all the inhabitants of Syria
we can think as a seafaring people, traded from
farther north. Little wonder that the people of
such a land should welcome the promise, so
strange to other ears: "There shall be no more
sea!" For many months in the year the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
of Judæa can count on letters only
"if they can land at Jaffa," and constantly, even
when mail-bags can be tossed into the small
boats, which alone can come ashore, passengers
are carried past, northward to Beirut, or south
to Egypt, to make a fresh attempt, often two
or three times repeated; and every year has
its record of drowning and disaster.</p>

<p>Sir John Maundeville, who is never at a loss
to account for anything that comes in his way,
gravely assures us that there was here formerly
"a good city of the Christians called Caiphas,
because Caiaphas first founded it." The town of
Haifa (the Arabic name being variously transliterated
Haifa and Caifa) is the old Sycaminum;
the modern town, however, stands farther within
the bay than the old, the ruins of which are
still visible at the foot of Mount Carmel. It was
built in the middle of the eighteenth century
by Dhaher, a famous governor of the neighbouring
Acre or Akko, which is the old Ptolemais.</p>

<p>Our quarters at Haifa were at the farther end
of the town, and after passing through streets
which, though better than in many places, are
decidedly Oriental as to width, paving, and dirt,
it was reposeful to find ourselves in the German
colony—a picturesque European village: wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
streets planted with trees, well-kept roads, gardens
gay with flowers, and houses which seem to have
been transported from some quaint, old country
town, each with its text in "black letter" over
the door. One, above all others, was to some
among us almost a place of pilgrimage, with all
its associations of a man of genius unappreciated,
misunderstood—one of the many messengers who,
with hands laden with gifts, sought to come unto
his own, and his own received him not!</p>

<p class="center bold">Wohl denen, die das Gebot halten und thun immerdar Recht.<br />
Hans Oliphant.</p>

<p>Not England, and not America, carry on his
work of—literally—sweetness and light, but the
Germans. Haifa is practically a German town
so far as its trade, agriculture, and property are
concerned. Even the Russian, American, and,
till lately, the English consuls are Germans, and
most officials, of whatever nationality, reside in
the colony. The hotels, shops, and banks are
German. The Roman Catholic hospital and
hospice are in the hands of a German sisterhood;
the sanatorium on Mount Carmel with its
luxurious accommodation and extensive grounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
<i>rendezvous</i> of English missionaries, is conducted
by Germans.</p>

<p>The Scottish medical mission, here as elsewhere
preaching the Gospel of good deeds, has an
admirable hospital. <i>The Jerusalem and the East
Mission</i> has a chaplain. The great hospice
on Mount Carmel is maintained by the Carmelite
Fathers. Out of 12,000 inhabitants half are
Moslems, sixteen hundred Jews, and about a
thousand Greek, Orthodox, and Latins. Of the
six hundred Europeans, five hundred are
Germans; the rest of the population is mainly
Maronite and Greek Catholic.</p>

<p>Plain living and high thinking are, of course,
the ideal of life, but there is a joy in unpacking,
in a hot bath, in a white table-cloth. Our companions
at table were mainly German engineers
and contractors, at work on the new railway.
We regretted that we were too late to see the
opening ceremony of a few days before, which
seems to have presented some interesting features,
and was certainly a triumph for the Turkish
Government. In spite of its execution having
been German—for even when in English hands
its surveyor was Dr Schumacher, the German-American
Vice-Consul—the Moslem ownership
of the railway has not been lost sight of, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
it is an interesting anomaly that its inauguration
was accompanied by the sacrifice of several sheep.
Their throats were cut, the blood poured upon
the soil, and the flesh roasted and given to the
poor. This is done "for a blessing." How far
this savage ceremony is a perpetuation of the
Old Testament idea of propitiating the Deity,
how far it is done to avert the attention of the
<i>jinn</i>, it is impossible to say. Similar ceremonies
are performed, both by Moslems and Christians,
at the initiation of any undertaking,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
from the opening of public works to the building of a
dwelling-house, the anointing with blood being
a necessary element.</p>

<p>To our great regret we were now to lose our
friend "Baedeker," to whom we owed so much
of pleasure and information. We had given him,
in return, much valuable advice on how to construct
a guide-book, framed on the analogy
of certain specimens beloved of tourists, from
which we had culled choice extracts for frequent
quotation, the general principles of which
seemed to be hasty generalisation and the
inculcation of moral lessons. We may incidentally
mention that the longer and better
one knows Syria the more one learns to appreciate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
the blessings of Baedeker and to
value its extreme accuracy, even in the smallest
particulars.</p>

<p>We devoted the next day to renewing our
stock of provisions at the excellent shops,
visiting friends, and, finally, to a ride up Mount
Carmel. Last year an Austrian boat, the
<i>Posseidon</i>, came ashore in this very treacherous
harbour, and among other passengers rescued
from the wreck were a cat and kittens, belonging
to the son of the captain. These kittens found
a kindly welcome among the German population,
and in two houses were introduced to our notice
with much pride. They were evidently accustomed
to attention, for their self-esteem
exceeded that of even other cats "subject to
vanity," and their Angora lineage, short faces,
tufted ears, bushy tales, and black toes justified
their claim to admiration. The Arab cat leaves
little to be desired as to pelage, but, as a rule,
his markings, black on white, would disgrace a
fox-terrier. He is, for the most part, well treated
in Palestine, and, in consequence, extremely intelligent;
but, like the Arabs themselves, and the
Arab donkeys, is too much <i>en evidence</i> for perfect
good breeding, and his "flashes of silence" are very
occasional, and generally due to sleep or food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
The ride up Mount Carmel was an occasion
never to be forgotten. The new carriage road
climbs the four hundred and eighty feet which
lead to the convent in wide sweeps, and is very
easy; but the direct ascent is abrupt, and the
views proportionately impressive. Northward, the
crescent-shaped bay terminated in Acre, with
all its associations of crusading times; while
far below us Haifa, and all its gardens, offered,
perhaps, the most smiling and prosperous picture
which Palestine had ever shown us. The detached
houses, buried in trees; the unwonted
completeness and order of the cultivation; the
miles of terraced vineyards, parents of the excellent
Haifa wine; the picturesque German colony;
the estates of Selim Effendi Khuri—the millionaire
of a district in which are many rich men,
mainly Germans; the orange and lemon gardens,
with their wealth of fruit, here a flame of bougainvilea,
there a bower of fragrant jessamine,
at intervals a group of stately palms—where else
can we find a prospect such as this?</p>

<p>And then, when we reached the top, was there
ever such a rock garden as extends for miles
along the summit of Carmel, the mountain which
travellers abuse, and for which guide-books
apologise? Did ever a January sky shine over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
a more marvellous wealth of beauty and of
promise? Rocks of limestone and hornstone;
a general effect of greenness, kept fresh at all
times of the year owing to the neighbourhood of
the sea and the constant dews; scattered shade
of sapling oaks, of carobs, hawthorns, elders,
Guelder-roses, pomegranates, acacias, almonds
now laden with bloom, arbutus, and tamarisks; an
undergrowth of azalea, genista, rock-rose, juniper,
a tangle of the glorious clematis <i>cirrhosa</i>, with
its delicate greenish blossom; myrtles, and "the
slender galingale"; ferns in every shady nook—the
<i>felis-mas</i>, <i>asplenium-trichomanes</i>, the scented
fern; <i>cheilanthes-fragrans</i>, the waving maiden-hair—a
feast of colour and sweetness; cyclamen,
crimson, pink, and white; hyacinths, blue; chrysanthemums,
golden; mandrakes, royal purple;
periwinkle, sapphire; anemone <i>coronaria</i>, scarlet,
purple, pink, white; the stately narcissus and
sweet jonquils; crocuses, golden, purple, and
white. And then the promise! How we longed
to wait a week or two, as we watched the strong
green swords of the bulbous and tuberous plants
preparing to defend their coming treasure; the
irises, great and small; the gladioli, the squills,
the star of Bethlehem, the hyacinths, the arums,
the orchises. Soon, too, there would be adonis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
red and yellow; scarlet ranunculus, chrysanthemums,
and later, asphodels, lupins, scented
stocks, lychnis, geraniums of many kinds, centaureas,
valerian and a hundred other blooms, which
had sent no word of their coming, and at which
we could only guess. To catalogue only seems
a sort of profanation.</p>

<div class="verse">But cannot praise; I love too much."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There, for the first time, we saw the beautiful
little sun-bird, although it is said to be common
in the Jericho district. To the uninstructed it is
a humming-bird, although one is assured that
they exist only in the New World. It is little
over four inches long, radiantly attired in purple,
green, and blue, with brilliant orange tufts upon
his shoulders, a wonderful metallic sheen over
all, and a long, curved bill. The little lady
who accompanies him, though far more humbly
dressed, is also dainty and fascinating in brown
shot with green. Another tiny bird which gave
us much delight was the long-tailed wren, <i>drymæca
gracilis</i>, which runs up tamarisk-trees like a tit,
with a little fan spread open behind it.</p>

<p>The scene gave a new meaning to familiar
words: "The desert shall rejoice, and blossom as
the rose. It shall blossom abundantly: the glory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency
of Carmel and Sharon." The flowers of Lebanon
and Sharon are also a joy and delight to the
beauty-loving eye, but to our fancy the excellency
of Carmel is supreme. The mountain at its
highest point is less than two thousand feet, but,
rising sheer from the sea, is more imposing than
many mountains of greater elevation. The entire
length of the range does not exceed fifteen miles;
but as only two villages, occupied mainly by
Druses and Greek Catholics, occur to break its
solitude, wild beasts—jackals, hyænas, wild boars,
and even occasional panthers—are still more or
less in possession, although the cultivation of
vines for the famous Haifa vintage, has carried
civilisation and humanity to a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>Of course, we visited the convent, with all its
hospitalities and its interesting historical associations:
its memories of pious anchorites, of their
union, in the fifth century, with one of the earliest
religious orders; of the Benedictines who, early
in the ninth century, built the Church of St
Margaret; of St Louis; of massacres which laid
desolate the convent; of the church turned into
a mosque; and finally of the restoration of
the order, with permission to rebuild. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
monastery was used as a hospital when Napoleon
besieged Acre, and the wounded, murdered by
the Turks, lie under a small pyramid in the
convent garden. Destroyed once more by the
Pasha of Acre in 1821, the buildings have been
again restored on a scale to accommodate the
large pilgrimages which come every year from
Europe. Even more humble pilgrims, natives
or Hindoos—for "the grotto of Elijah" and the
"school of the prophets" are venerated also by
Moslems—are not forgotten, and a special building
is provided for them at the base of the lighthouse,
which is under the care of the monastery.
It is said that an Italian, Brother Giovanni of
Frascati, is the real author of the reconstruction
of the Carmelite prosperity, for, sent by the
general of the order to inquire into the condition
of things, he found only wrecked walls, and, as
sole survivor of the order, a single brother, who
had taken refuge in Haifa. A firman was
obtained from Constantinople, and the two
brothers devoted themselves to the collection of
funds, with such results that in 1827, six years
after its destruction, a new foundation stone was
laid by Giovanni himself. Liberal gifts must
have followed, for, though severe in style, the
buildings are very spacious and solid, and include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
a good library, very handsome church, oratory,
and chapter-house.</p>

<p>A small chamber, little more than a cave, said
to have been the habitation of the three poor
Carmelites who inaugurated the return of the
order in 1636, has been recently converted into
a chapel dedicated to St Simon Stock, the
Kentishman who was general of the order in
Palestine in 1245.</p>

<p>We lingered to see the sunset clouds gather
above the Mediterranean, and then rode over the
top of the ridge, and so back to the town, almost
grudging to go indoors as the stars sprang out
and the red roofs and green palms and olives of
the German village faded away into greys and
purples. After dinner we had the privilege of examining
Dr Schumacher's precious little museum
at the American consulate, and of seeing the
map of his survey of the East Jordanland, the
first that has yet been completed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Our</span>
departure next morning—our little party
reduced to three and one mukari—was
somewhat delayed by the conduct of Sadowi,
who, brought up in Moslem surroundings, firmly
protested against being ridden past a pig in the
streets of Haifa. If it had been a lion he could
not have objected more strongly, and as the
movement of a pig is not rapid our progress, for
the length of an entire street, was a work of time.
We were bound for Nazareth, only some twenty-four
miles distant, along a fairly good road, but
this was, on the whole, the most wearisome day
of our journey. A chain is no stronger than its
weakest link; Khalil had to lead the Artist's
horse at a walk, our second servant had gone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
and even if we had known the way, or if it had
seemed prudent to divide our forces, our horses
had no confidence in Frenjy, and so firmly refused
to separate from their stable companions—human
and equine—that, after disputing the question
with them until we were tired, we abandoned
ourselves to the dragging pace which is so wearing
to horse and rider, and which protracted our
journey till late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Descending after three miles into the fertile
plain of the Kishon we retraced our road towards
Megiddo for some miles, and then climbed to
higher ground, and passed through a succession
of beautiful groves of oak, very rare in this
country, and which, we regretted to see, had
been partially destroyed in the construction of
the new carriage road from Haifa to Tiberias.
Once more descending we reached, about fifteen
miles from Haifa, the village of Semûniyeh,
historically interesting as being the first settlement
in Palestine of the German Society of
Templars, who have done so much for commerce
and agriculture, and have demonstrated, as no
other Europeans have done, by their well-built,
well-arranged colonies, the fact that it is possible
to live a domestic life under conditions of order,
beauty, and sanitation even in Palestine. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
first site, however promising and pleasing to
the eye, was not, however, well chosen, for the
spring, bordered with flowers and shaded with
maiden-hair, turned out to be very unwholesome.
We passed, just below, the little village of Yâfâ,
where since 1641 the Franciscans have possessed
a small chapel, on the alleged site of the house of
Zebedee. The villagers are mainly Latins and
Greek Orthodox.</p>

<p>The town of Nazareth is so buried in a cleft
of the hills that it came into sight quite suddenly,
lying to the left of the road, with a few separated
buildings, mostly modern institutions, the most
striking of which is the immense orphanage of
the Salesian Fathers, with its long arcades and
its exalted position. A convent of Poor Clares
is the only building noticeable to the right of the
road; on the left we pass a pleasant-looking
hotel (German) and some half-dozen houses, and
we are at the gates of the Franciscan hospice,
a handsome building, capable of accommodating
over two hundred guests, with spacious reception-rooms
and every modern convenience, built
mainly by the liberality of Americans, and known,
in consequence, as Notre Dame d'Amerique. Its
hospitality, like that of all the Franciscan hospices,
is open to all, rich and poor, irrespective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
of sex, creed, or nationality. Guests are at
liberty to leave a gift for the maintenance of
the house; but nothing is asked, and the Lady
related several instances, personally known to
her, in which it had been declined owing to
the circumstances, known or suspected, of the
visitor.</p>

<p>One's emotions on finding oneself in Nazareth
are, like so many of the most sacred things in
life, "nothing to speak of." Easier is it to dwell
upon our hearty welcome and kindly companionship,
upon the refreshment of comfortable rooms
and an excellent table, upon the unattractiveness
of the modern town and the superfluous
philanthropy and multiplication of benevolent
institutions.</p>

<p>After "the cup that cheers," and which a
Franciscan hospice anywhere in Palestine may
be warranted to produce at sight of an Englishwoman,
we wandered forth, rather rashly, in the
twilight. The Lady alleged that the ground-plan
of the town could only be compared with
Clovelly—each house looks down the next-door
chimneys, or would if chimneys there were.
The streets appeared to be about nine feet wide.
On either side is a pavement wide enough for
one person; the middle is a water-course, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
drain, or a depository for decaying vegetable
matter according to the character of the quarter.
If you meet a donkey your conversation with
your companion across the street is interrupted
till it has clattered past; if it is loaded you
flatten yourself against the wall; if you meet a
camel you step inside the nearest house. The
people have the manners of those accustomed
to tourists and to superfluously benevolent institutions:
the women stare boldly, the children
demand backsheesh, the men have lost the
Oriental courtesy so welcome in less frequented
places.</p>

<p>The population is about ten thousand, of whom
thirty-five hundred are Moslems, and thirty-five
hundred Greeks; about twenty-eight hundred
Catholics, Latin, Greek, and Maronite, and
about two hundred and fifty Protestants. The
people are prosperous, mainly as agriculturists,
but there is also some commerce in cotton and
grain.</p>

<p>The Franciscans, besides their own college for
novices, have a school for boys; the Salesians an
orphanage for boys; the Christian Brothers a
school for boys, with higher grade as well as
elementary teaching; the Dames de Nazareth
an orphanage and school for girls; the Sisters of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
St Joseph a school for girls and a dispensary;
the Brothers of St John the Divine a hospital
and dispensary; the Sisters of Charity all the
miscellaneous works of care for young and old,
for homeless and infirm, with which everywhere
they fill up the gaps left by others. The Greeks,
Russians, Maronites—all have their own institutions;
the Russians a very large hospice for
pilgrims. The Edinburgh Medical Mission has a
church and hospital, and the English have a small
orphanage for girls, founded by the Society for
Female Education, which, despite its unattractive
title, has done some excellent work in Palestine.
How, out of a Christian population of about three
thousand (exclusive of Greek Orthodox, and in
a well-to-do town), enough material is collected
to furnish occupation to so many societies, and
the means of spending so much money as is here
represented, is beyond the understanding of the
mere layman!</p>

<p>Darkness fell suddenly, and in the narrow, unlighted
streets we—to our own self-contempt at
so unusual a circumstance—lost our way, got
mixed with a long train of camels which, whether
standing or sitting, barricaded our steps in all
directions, and were finally rescued by a lad
speaking very good French, who lifted the Lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
bodily over pack-saddles and humps of camels,
drove her under arches formed by the front and
hind legs of camels, held aside for her the investigating
muzzles of camels, defended her from
the hind legs of camels, and finally, to her great
surprise, delivered her safe at the convent door,
and disappeared into the dark.</p>

<p>Next day we visited all the traditional sites,
known by description to all the world. The
great Church of the Annunciation, rich with
costly gifts of marbles, and silver, and pictures,
on the site of that built by Constantine, is the
parish church of the Franciscans. The present
building is not older than the beginning of the
eighteenth century; its immediate predecessor
having been burnt and pillaged by the Bedu
from beyond the Jordan. A very simple chapel
covers a part of the foundations, still visible, of
a crusading church, on ground bought by the
Franciscans a hundred and fifty years ago, and
which they hope some day to restore. The
timeworn arches, the fragments of masonry
standing silent and solitary in a walled garden,
among well-ordered flower-beds—the tradition
that this was the site of the workshop of Joseph,
the village carpenter, impressed us more than
all the wealth, the multiplied legends of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
handsome Church of the Annunciation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
The Franciscans have also a chapel covering the
rock said to be the scene of one of the occasions
when our Lord, after His resurrection, was
known in the breaking of bread. The Greek
Catholics are in possession of the church which
is associated with the synagogue in which Jesus
is said to have preached, and from which He
was cast out; the Greek Orthodox of a chapel
which covers one of the springs of the village
well. Here, as in many other places where
only one well exists, we may feel certain of at
least one scene of many sacred associations.</p>

<p>Later in the day the Lady and the Doctor rode
up to the top of one of the many hills, which
stand out like islands or peninsulas in the plain,
and from which, but a mile or two beyond the
village, one has a view which is an epitome of
Old and New Testament history. It is said that
one may see thirty miles in three directions:
east to the valley of the Jordan and the hills
of Gilead beyond, west to the Mediterranean,
and in the nearer foreground one may look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
upon the battlefields of Esdraelon, on Carmel
and Tabor, on the scenes of the history of
Elijah, Barak, Gideon, of the death of Saul,
of the struggles of the Maccabees, of the life
of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>Here, once more, one cannot fail to be struck
by the falsity of conventional teaching. No
meditation on the boyhood of Jesus is complete
without its paragraph as to the obscurity
of His home, the remoteness of this
Galilean village, its aloofness from the life and
history of the times. The very phrase "Can
any good thing come out of Nazareth?" is taken
in support of its insignificance, instead of evidence
of the well-known character for turbulence
of its inhabitants—a character said, by those in
political authority, to be still prominent to-day.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the stimulus of its
surrounding scenery it is obvious to the most
elementary student that Nazareth was very
little removed from the most crowded highway,
from the centre of the busiest life of Palestine;
that—to speak it with reverence—an intelligent
boy, wandering about the neighbourhood as boys
will, would bring in every day news of all the
activities, the competitions, the commerce, the
politics of the times. Midianite caravans making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
their way to the fords of the Jordan would
tell of all the wealth and learning of Egypt, and
reflect somewhat of its contact with Europe;
Damascus caravans coming south or returning
home from trading expeditions; pilgrims going
up to Jerusalem to the feasts, and bringing
back news of the capital, the <i>rendezvous</i> of all
Jewry; lords and princes with their retinues
travelling from the Greek cities of the
Decapolis to the Greek city of Tiberias, but a
few hours distant; Roman legions marching
south; luxurious ladies going down to winter
among the palm gardens of Jericho; learned men
travelling from one city to another; peripatetic
teachers as the fashion was; Herod and his
Court removing from Tiberias to Sebaste, to
Jericho, to Jerusalem—all such spectacles would
be of daily occurrence, a part of that human
training which made the Master, perfect Man;
which taught Him sympathy not only with
those who frequented the carpenter's workshop
and the fisherman's hut, but with a learning, a
civilisation, a life, which brings Him nearer to
us and to our own temptations and interests
than some would have us think; which made it
necessary that His teachings should be represented
not only by the Synoptic gospels but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
by the author of the fourth gospel, by the
Epistle to the Hebrews, by the philosophy of
St Paul.</p>

<p>Looking down from our elevation at a scene
which showed the ploughman with his yoke,
the sower with his basket, the busy little town,
the many schools, hospitals, orphanages; the
hospitalities of the Franciscans and the Russians,
frequented, later in the year, by persons of every
class and nationality; the buildings in progress,
the vehicles and laden beasts travelling seawards
to Haifa, in touch with all the commerce
of the age, we turned for one moment to the
convent of Poor Clares at our feet, with the
passing thought that asceticism, inactivity, contemplation
such as this, was an anomaly compared
not only with our own life but with that
of Him whom they would serve.</p>

<p>The Artist's horse required an off day or two,
and the roads were in such good condition that
it was arranged that the Artist should follow in
a carriage, as the rest of the party had a long
day in prospect. The Church of the Annunciation
had been crowded every evening with
village people, singing special litanies, and praying
for rain. "I thought of your long ride, and
prayed with mixed feelings," said a kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
Father; "but the majority are against you, and
you had better make the most of the time. I
saw 'as it were a man's hand' over Carmel!"</p>

<p>Accordingly we set off at twilight next morning,
and saw the sun rise over the hills of
Galilee. The little town had not yet awakened
to life, and not a single woman waited with
her pitcher at the well which yesterday had
been a scene of so much activity. We had
planned to visit the Austrian hospital, where so
much science and surgical skill are devoted to
the poor by the Brothers of St John the Divine,
but the early start and a change in our route
made this impossible. The country hereabouts
is not in itself interesting, except for the beauty
of colouring, which is never wanting in Palestine,
and for the associations of which we were everywhere
reminded. We looked back at the Mount
of Precipitation, with its sheer precipice of 1000
feet, at the range of Carmel, at Tabor and
Hermon, at the wide plain to the south and the
rising ground beyond, where, in Nain and Endor
and Shunem, men and women were still perplexed
by the mysteries of life and death.</p>

<p>Khalil chose to conduct us off the highroad,
which seemed to us better adapted to the imperfect
light, and over some very rough ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
through the village of Gath-Hepher, birthplace
of Jonah, and where, as may be gathered from
the presence of his tomb, he was also buried.
He was, additionally, buried near Jaffa, and
somewhere in the direction of Hebron—circumstances
of a nature not unusual in the case of
saints and heroes popular among the faithful of
more than one confession. This, we gathered,
was his Moslem burial-place.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes later we reached the
spring of Kefr Kennâ, probably the Cana of
the New Testament, and, if so, the source of the
water that was made wine. The women, somewhat
wild-looking and unkempt at this early
hour, were filling their jars from the sarcophagus
into which the water runs; but they offered no
discourtesy, and made no demands for backsheesh.
It was barely seven o'clock when we rode into
the courtyard of the little Latin church built
over the alleged site of the first miracle of Jesus.
The Franciscans in charge of the mission were
in church, we were told, and we made our
way in, and found the father (with the single attendant
brother) saying his office by the light
of a solitary candle. When he had finished he
hastened to place himself at our disposal, showed
us the church, and afterwards invited us to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
refreshment. The church is a little gem, both
as to architecture and decoration. It is seldom
one can honestly admire a modern church in
this country, as, however good the building may
be, it is generally hideously disfigured by the offerings
of the faithful. However, at Cana there
are no nuns to make crochet and paper flowers,
no opportunities for grateful Arabs to testify
piety by Christmas-tree balls. All is of rich simplicity,
and the Père Curé is too good an archæologist
to allow of the usual glaring anomalies.
The church, built in 1880, stands on the site of
an older one, visible below the present flooring
at various points where trap-doors are open to
exhibit, here an inscription in mosiac, there a
fragment of wall or of carving; but it may be
doubted whether these belong to the church
built by Helena and described by Paula in the
fourth, Antoninus Martyr in the sixth, and
Willibald in the seventh century; and visited,
according to Michaud, by St Louis, in May 1251,
with his wife, Margaret of Provence. A large
earthenware jar is shown in the church, of antique
design and of local manufacture, in illustration of
those in use in the time of our Lord. The
amount of wine that six such water-pots would
contain was, indeed, a princely wedding-gift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
In the simple little presbytery, at right angles
with the church, curiously reminiscent of many an
one in the Highlands of Scotland, we tasted the
wine of Cana of Galilee, the red wine of the district,
pure and refreshing, with the cordial quality
of Burgundy rather than the acidity of claret.</p>

<p>A little Franciscan oratory, built upon the
foundations of an ancient chapel, which, in its
turn, became a mosque, marks the traditional site
of the house of Nathaniel. The adjoining ground
now serves as a cemetery. We retraced our steps
to the entrance of the village, and returned once
more to the Great Plain, where, as we passed by
the village of Nahallal, the conviction was forced
upon us that the praying agriculturists were
about to meet with the fulfilment of their hopes.
We had talked of the great black clouds which
had been gathering ever since our departure as
"fine atmospheric effects," and had refused to
listen to the kindly warnings of our good friends
at Cana, but we looked with some dismay at
the wide, shelterless valley we must cross before
reaching the foot of Mount Tabor, where protection
among the trees might be hoped for.
Fortunately, there was no wind, so the horses
made no objection to the rain, although the
abrupt, rocky descent into the valley was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
slippery. The climb beyond we made on foot,
partly out of regard for our horses and partly
for the pleasure of delaying at will to enjoy
the views and examine the flora.</p>

<p>The flowers and shrubs were very interesting,
but less varied than on Carmel; and the clouds
somewhat obscured the view until we reached
the top, when a grand panorama burst upon us.
It was a steep climb, for the mountain is two
thousand and eighteen feet, and the plain can be
very little above sea-level. However, the road
is good, and we were rewarded by the discovery
of a dolmen, of which we have not been able to
find any record, the more interesting in that they
are exceedingly rare west of the Jordan. Fragments
of walls and heaps of stones, at various
levels, show traces of earlier habitation; and,
indeed, it has been lately maintained that, at the
time of our Lord, the mountain was too thickly
populated for such a scene as the Transfiguration
to be at all possible. The evidence on this point
is very conflicting, and the authorities at variance
have been carefully discussed by P. Barnabé d'Alsace,
who, unlike many critics of Holy Land sites,
is familiar with the locality under consideration.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
Lightfoot was the first to express, in 1675, doubt
on the subject, mainly on the ground that a friend
of his who had climbed the mountain said that it
did not tally with the description of Josephus.
Granted, for the sake of argument, that the
village of the time of Josephus was equally large
in the time of our Lord, the existence of an
ancient cemetery sets a limit to its eastern extension,
as a burial ground could never have been
included within a Jewish city. The distance
from the cemetery to the edge of the plateau
exceeds the distance from the walls of Jerusalem
to the Garden of Gethsemane, and the solitude
of the Agony has never been called in question.</p>

<p>When we reached the top of the mountain
we found ourselves facing a substantial gateway,
worthy of the entrance to a park, and with a good
carriage drive beyond. Arguing, from force of
habit, that a desired end is never approached in
this country by a straightforward path, and being
wet, hungry, and tired, we reflected that to climb
two or three walls, drop into a kitchen garden, and
then across a long, ploughed field with no visible
means of exit, was the most likely method to
bring us quickly within reach of food and shelter.
Accordingly we arrived, in time, at a group of
buildings, defended by a number of indignant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
dogs, from whom we were happily separated by a
locked gate. Their remonstrances brought forth
assistance, and we were finally rescued by a
Greek monk, who welcomed us kindly, although
to the wrong convent. The Doctor made a rush
at some Arabic inscriptions leaning against the
west wall of the church; and, of course, we paid
a visit to the church itself, within which some
remains of an ancient building are preserved,
consisting of two apses and part of a mosaic pavement,
possibly belonging to the Church of St
Elias, and probably of the fourth or fifth century.
A little boy led us finally into the right path, and
in a few minutes we were within the kindly hospice
of the Franciscans, and, but little later, in the presence
of a breakfast which we felt we had, for
once, earned in the sweat of our brow. A German
father and a Dutch brother supplied all our needs,
and refreshed us, moreover, with much pleasant
talk, reminding us that our climb had been
accomplished by the Empress Helena "in her
eighties."</p>

<p>The plateau is covered with ruined churches
and convents, as the mountain has been held
sacred from a very early period—the earliest
known mention of it as the site of the Transfiguration
being in the Apocryphal gospel according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
to the Hebrews, the exact date of which is not
established more precisely than that it was known
to St Ignatius, who died in 107. The mountain
is mentioned by Origen and St Jerome, and
was visited by several early pilgrims—Paula,
Antoninus Martyr, our English Willibald, and
others. The earliest convent was established by
the Benedictines in 1100; but as early as the sixth
century the three tabernacles, desired by St Peter,
were already built.</p>

<p>The Franciscan buildings, which are very
simple, date only from 1873, when the Friars
Minor first obtained a footing on the mountain,
the Greeks (Orthodox) having preceded them by
five or six years.</p>

<p>Climbing on to a platform of masonry, at the
western end of the plateau, we were much encouraged,
on looking N.E. towards Tiberias in
the direction in which we were going, to observe
a blue sky, and the hoary head of Hermon gleaming
bright in clear sunshine.</p>

<p>It was a hint to depart, and we hastened,
despite intermittent "April showers," to begin
our descent, which, to our regret, had to be made
by the same path by which we had ascended.
We had hoped to have enjoyed the variety of
examining the northern or eastern slope.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />

<small>THE SEA OF GALILEE</small></h3>

<div class="quotes">

 <p>"We go to the Sea of Galilee ... and although they call it a sea, it is
 neither a sea nor arm of the sea; for it is but a stank of fresh water
 ... and it hath in it great plenty of good fish, and the River Jordan
 runs through it."—<span class="smcap">Sir John Maundeville</span>, 1322</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span>
was a glorious ride from Tabor to Tiberias.
The rain clouds hastened westward, and, as
we heard later, gratified the thirsty souls at
Nazareth, and left us to a thorough enjoyment
of our day. We were delighted to find ourselves
off the beaten track, for the carriage road
to Tiberias was considerably to our north. We
had been told, to our satisfaction, that the alternative
road by way of Tabor, as it lay a little low,
did not give us such frequent glimpses of parts
of the lake, but that we should come upon the
glorious prospect all at once, and the expectation
kept us constantly on the watch. Our road
lay for the most part through well-cultivated
country, belonging partly to the Bedu and
partly to the Circassians, and the wide fields, in
which the corn was springing, were a delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
and refreshing sight. We pictured what it would
be later in the year to ride, as we were assured
we might, through vegetation up to the saddle—barley,
maize, sesame, doura, with yellow
marguerite and blue eryngo, and campanulas
of every shade, raising proud heads above the
golden wealth. We were, however, quite content
with the garden which had been prepared
for us—such an one would be, indeed, difficult to
find anywhere else, in such combination, and in
the first week of January. Perhaps one great
charm of it all was that it was just such a day,
and such a spectacle, as one might enjoy, three
months later in parks and gardens at home—only
glorified as to colour, size, and fragrance, and that
here all the flowers were the wild children of
Mother Nature. Capers, fennel, asparagus, and
scores of balsamic herbs, in which the bees were
gaily humming, took us, in thought, into the
kitchen gardens of home, now lying under a
white coverlet in winter sleep. Here all was
so warm in the sunshine that lizards, and even
chameleons and tortoises, had wakened up to
greet the glad new year.</p>

<p>We passed the immense ruins of a fine khan
of fifteenth-century workmanship, and those of
an Arab castle on a height beyond, both now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
serving only as refuge to the flocks of the Bedu,
who, on account of the presence of an excellent
spring, seek shelter about its walls. Circassian
and Bedawy cultivation we had seen, wide tracts
in possession of the Jews were pointed out to
us at a distance, and at Kafr Sabt we found
a village of peasantry from Algeria. Somewhat
to the north, the twin peaks of Karn Hattîn
looked down upon this aggregation of race and
creed—the scene, according to a tradition (not,
however, older than the sixteenth century), of
the Sermon on the Mount. The same mountain
has another association, that of the battle in July
1187, in which Salah ed-din totally defeated the
Franks, and gave the death-blow to their power
in Palestine. King Guy de Lusignan was taken
prisoner, the knights were sold as slaves, the
Templars and Hospitallers executed, on the very
site where, perhaps, the Master, looking down
the avenue of centuries, had said: "Blessed are
the merciful, the peacemakers, the pure in heart."
Whether the blessings were any more applicable
to the Christian Crusader than to the
Moslem conqueror is a point upon which the
testimony of history leaves one somewhat in
doubt.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley, into which we soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
descended, followed close by a family party of
Jews, who seemed glad of the protection of our
presence, we found ourselves upon a wide, fertile
plain bounded by a water-course;—that we noted
the water-courses is a sign that we have been
living in arid Judæa;—and then we rose once
more, and for the last time, reaching the plateau
of Ard el Hammâ, when the promised view
burst upon us. Our Jews were actually alarmed
by our simultaneous shout of delight: Khalil
only smiled sardonically, quite inured to the
unaccountable pleasure which the Frenjys exhibited
over what not even an Armenian or a
Government official could turn into so much as
a bishlik (value 6d.).</p>

<p>The Sea of Tiberias is about thirteen miles
long by five to eight wide; its proportions much
those of Windermere; its form an irregular oval;
indeed, it is said that its ancient name of Kinnerôt
is derived from Kinnor, a lute, in allusion to its
shape. It lies 681 feet below the Mediterranean,
so that it has an almost subtropical, and very
abundant, vegetation. The steep hills are of
moderate height; but great Hermon, looking
over their shoulders at the northern end, dwarfs
all else into insignificance. There is, for the
most part, but a ribbon of coast, green with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
herbage and trees, and bordered with glistening
sand and shells. It is like a bonnie Highland
loch, not wooded like Loch Lomond, nor, on
the other hand, bare like Coruisk, but smiling,
peaceful, inviting to repose. The very sight of
such a quantity of water was refreshing to us,
coming, as we did, from a city where it is often
cheaper to drink a bottle, or even two, of wine,
than to take a bath. In little villages dotted
along the shore we could fancy that we might
hear the kindly Gaelic instead of the Arabic,
which has, however, many similar sounds; the
laddie herding on yonder hill is playing an
instrument "own brother" to the chanters, and
snow-crowned Hermon dominates his world like
Cruachan or Schiehallion. The extreme southern
end is hidden from us, and we must advance to
the very edge of the cliff to see Tiberias
lying at our feet—a long line of houses,
varied by palms and minarets. At this distance,
and before bettering our acquaintance
with details, it is not difficult to reconstruct in
imagination the city which must have been, in
the time of Jesus, one of the many glories of
Galilee. To realise the sheen and consistency
of its beauty we have to remember that the
whole had been newly built by Herod upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
long-deserted site; that palace and race-course
and citadel and forum, a great synagogue for
the Jews (who refused, however, to enter the
city), a wall three miles long, were all new, and
all part of an artistic plan. We must remember
that this was only one of nine cities, all more
or less Greek in architecture and customs, said
to have contained each, at least, fifteen thousand
inhabitants—an almost unbroken chain around
the lake, now so solitary that one's eye finds
with difficulty traces of humanity otherwhere
than in and about Tiberias, now a squalid townlet
of four thousand inhabitants. As Sebaste
was called after Augustus, so the name of
Tiberius was given to this city—perhaps the
old Rakkath. When the foundations were laid,
quantities of human bones were laid bare, and
the Jews refused to dwell in a city ceremonially
unclean, so that Herod was driven to populate
his new possession with the scum of the
country. To judge from our later acquaintance
with the manners and customs of the inhabitants
their descendants are still in possession,
reinforced by a still larger number of Jews, of
whom, indeed, two-thirds of the population now
consists. Rich gardens once existed where now
are only swamps, beautiful to the eye, but breathing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
out malarial fever; and fleets of sails met
the eyes of Jesus and His fishermen friends
where now we can discover but two little
rowing-boats. Khalil pointed out the spot
where, as he said, Jesus had made forty loaves
of bread, and was much hurt that we did not
take a note of the story, as we had done of
other traditions. The story was true, he affirmed,
and the company had eaten them with their fish.</p>

<p>Our horses were in good mood to-day, and we
made them descend the steep hillside above
Tiberias, by which we not only cut short the
tortuous windings of the road but obtained a
quick series of points of view, which furnished a
panorama wonderful in colour and outline. The
approach has still a certain grandeur. The wall
and gateway, probably entirely ineffective as such,
are picturesque in their decay. They are, indeed,
of no great age, and may even belong only to
the eighteenth-century restoration, when the town
was refortified, to be again destroyed by an earthquake
in 1837. We passed some modern European
buildings, including a small but inviting
little German hotel, and the hospital and manse
of the mission of the Free Church of Scotland,
and, still descending, paused before the gate of
the Franciscan hospice. The rain which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
had seen ahead of us in the morning had fallen
in Tiberias, and the streets were simply ditches
of dirty water, with occasional islands, upon one
of which we descended, and then, with a spring,
found ourselves in the orderly courtyard.</p>

<p>A hearty welcome awaited us from the Brother
in charge, an old friend, formerly gardener in the
Garden of Gethsemane, and still practising his
art, as the neat flower-beds and well-trained
creepers testified.</p>

<p>The Arabs say that the king of fleas lives at
Tiberias; if so, he holds his court elsewhere than
at the hospices—here and at Et Tâbigha, where
next day we were kindly and comfortably entertained.
After dinner we climbed to the roof, and
had a glorious view of the lake, and of Mount
Hermon, and of the tall palms waving in the
moonlight. An epidemic of cholera in 1903 produced
a fearful mortality, amounting, it is said, to
one-fourth of the population, and of these over
three-fourths were Jews, probably owing to the
extreme filth of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Next morning we set off, after an early breakfast,
to ride up to the north end of the lake. Our
farther journey, to Besan, would take us southward,
and we were warned not to attempt the
eastern shore without an escort, as the Bedu there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
are very wild. We passed the neat hospital and
manse, covered with a crimson flame of bougainvillea,
and shaded by pleasant trees, with gardens
sloping down to the water, and in a few minutes
were out of sight of the town, with only the blue
lake, with its green margin and surrounding hills,
to feast our eyes upon. Ruins, wells with stone
enclosures, rock tombs—all speak of a past population.
The first sign of present habitation was
a miserable village, said to be Magdala. Even
here some massive fragments of wall testify to
earlier prosperity. Here the shore widens out
into the plain of Gennesaret, bounded towards
the south-east by a rugged hill, in which are many
large caves, formerly the stronghold of robbers,
which were fortified without, and adapted for
residence by long connecting galleries, and by
cisterns, which collected water for the occupants.
These bandits gave much trouble to Herod the
Great, as they were practically unassailable, the
only access to their homes being in the face of
a rock eleven hundred feet high. They were
finally reached by means of lowering soldiers
from the top in cages, and were ultimately overpowered.
At a later date these fortified caverns
were utilised by Josephus in his struggle with the
Romans, and still later they served as hermitages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
According to some authorities, Taricheæ is to
be identified with Magdala, though others place
it farther south. Its associations are historical
and commercial, not religious. The name signifies
"pickling-place"; and the salt fish of Galilee
were known throughout the Roman Empire—large
quantities were taken up to Jerusalem at
feast-times, and barrels exported to the shores of
the Mediterranean. The great draughts of fish
such as we read of in the gospels must have
been brought to Taricheæ for preservation, otherwise
they would have been wasted in this subtropical
climate.</p>

<p>A little past Mejdel our road led us down to the
very edge of the lake, where we were tempted to
dismount to gather shells, which are very beautiful
and varied. The shore is fringed all the way with
oleander-bushes, "the blossoms red and bright"
of Keble's poem—one of those touches of realism
in his verses which are the more remarkable that
he was never in Palestine. Khalil thought our
occupation very childish, and never could understand
why we should want to walk when we were
paying for horses to ride upon. Before long we
were forced to mount again by the necessity of
having to cross several streams making their way
down to the lake. The path gradually ascended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
till we found ourselves following an aqueduct
along a very narrow ridge at some height above
the water, just after passing the ruins of the large
Khan Minyeh, to which it had served to conduct
water in the days of Salah ed-din. We had
forcible illustration of the sudden storms for which
this lake has been always known, for just as we
were carefully picking our way along our precarious
path a sudden squall arose, and in a moment the
wind was whistling about us, rain was dashing in
our faces, and the lake was beating angrily upon
the shore. There was an instant's question of
sheltering among the fig-trees below or of going
back; but we would not give in, and after some
twenty minutes of discomfort, we came suddenly
upon a little group of buildings, obviously European.
The Doctor dismounted to beg shelter,
and in a very few minutes we found ourselves
within the hospitable walls of the hospice of the
German Catholic Palæstina Verein. This was a
welcome surprise; we had heard of this mission
and its hospitalities, but had not realised that we
were already at Ain et Tâbigha (possibly Bethsaida),
and actually under the roof of the well-known
Father Biever, of whom we had heard
so much at Madaba.</p>

<p>The house was in course of structural alteration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
a good deal of furniture encumbered the
wide piazza, workmen were sheltering from the
rain, the Father himself was absent, but none of
these difficulties subtracted from the cordiality
of our welcome. Our horses were stabled, and
we, laying aside our wraps, prepared to stay to
luncheon. It was an ideal spot: the house built
upon a narrow terrace, the bank laid out in
gardens sloping down to the water's edge, the
arcade covered with roses, among which the
<i>Maréchal Niel</i> was conspicuous; abundance of
flowers of various kinds, and a friendly family
of cats, dogs, ducks of the handsome Aleppo
breed, and some fine poultry and pigeons, added
to the attractions.</p>

<p>Our vice-host, Father Biever's companion and
assistant priest, made us soon feel at home, and
we were not difficult to persuade that the rain was
far too persistent to make our return possible,
and that we had better take up our quarters
in the hospice till the morrow. Khalil was despatched
back to Tiberias to relieve the anxieties
of the Artist, and we settled down, very thankful
to be out of the storm.</p>

<p>We were greatly interested in our passing
glimpse of a life which seemed to us to have
something of the practical usefulness, the self-renunciation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
of real mission work. Here were
two highly-cultivated men deliberately and permanently
establishing themselves in a spot where,
for three hours' north and but little less south,
they had no single neighbour except the Bedu,
and one solitary Franciscan, whose acquaintance
we were to make next day. Their own immediate
household includes some four or five
Arabs who serve the hospice, and assist in the
labour of the well-kept fields and gardens, by
which the house is largely supported, and lessons
of practical utility taught to the surrounding
natives. One of these was pointed out to us
as the best fisherman on the lake, and we asked
him to explain the use of the nets, which were
lying under the wall of the house. He proceeded
to collect one, which seemed to be circular, perhaps
twenty feet in diameter, into large folds
with his left hand. The mesh was fine, and the
net, in spite of its size, easily grasped. Transferring
it to his right hand, with a quick movement
he threw the net from him, when it expanded
into a large circle, so that one easily
understood how the casting of such a net might
include "a multitude of fishes."</p>

<p>Tristram says: "The lake swarms with fish as
I could not have believed water could swarm";
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
but though fourteen species are reckoned as
inhabiting the lake only four or five are ordinarily
on the market. There are some, however, of
exceptional interest, not only to the learned in
such matters, but also to the merely observant
like ourselves.</p>

<p>These include two species found nowhere else
outside of the tropics—one the <i>chromis simonis</i>,
of which one species, the <i>chromis paterfamilias</i>,
for several weeks carries the eggs and the young,
to the number, it is said, of two hundred, in his
mouth; the other, the <i>clarias macracanthus</i>,
which emits a sound: it was known to Josephus
as the <i>coracinus</i>. Several varieties of the <i>capoéta
Damascéna</i>, the luminous fish, are also found
here.</p>

<p>There was so much to hear of interest that
we were almost thankful to the rain for keeping
us indoors. These solitary priests have adapted
themselves to their environment in a manner
which, were it more customary among religious
teachers, would be of infinite value not only to
religion but to science. One cannot think without
regret of the wealth of information lost to the
archæologist, anthropologist, philologist by the
neglect of those who might secure unrivalled
opportunities of intercourse with the people, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
many of whom after years in this country, leave
it as ignorant as when they came, of all that lies
beneath the surface. Our friends here, though
able to converse in, at least, three or four European
languages, use Arabic as their vernacular,
speaking it even between themselves, the better
to enter into the life of the people; they are good
horsemen and good shots, two qualifications absolutely
necessary for friendship with the Bedu.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
They possess, in addition to the animals necessary
to the hospice, a beautiful Arab mare, the gift
of one of the Madaba flock, and a very fine
specimen of the Arab deerhound, not unlike an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
Irish deerhound in appearance, but swift as the
gazelle which it hunts, and so exquisitely light
of limb, without the hideous attenuation of the
English greyhound, that such a dog is almost
invariably known as "Rischân" (feather), feminine,
"Rischi." Father Biever was originally an officer
in the German army; hence, probably, his power
of organisation. He has also a natural capacity
for architecture, as is testified by the very large
and handsome Convent of St Pierre, perhaps the
most effective modern building in Jerusalem, of
which he was the architect and practical builder,
in addition, it is said, to his having collected a
part of the cost in America, where he had some
experience of life among the cowboys. He made
a very large collection of the flowers of the
country, which, unfortunately, was lost with the
vessel in which it was sent to Europe. It is to
be earnestly hoped that his unique collection of
the folklore of the Bedu and fellahin may be
given to literature.</p>

<p>We were fortunate in happening to be present
at an interesting little social ceremony. Our
visit fell on Epiphany, and all the neighbours,
Bedu and Druse, came in the evening to celebrate
the visit of the Three Kings. The long hall
was simply furnished with a table, moved aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
for the occasion, and a divan running round the
walls. It was brightly lighted, and the household
servants presided over the refreshments, which
consisted of tea and some confectionery, specially
made for the occasion, of very rich and sweet
pastry, some of it in the form of puffs containing
honey, and the rest in narrow rolls, which are
known as "the fingers of Mary."</p>

<p>The company arrived all together, men and
boys (the women, of course, being left at home),
all dressed alike in the long robe, shawl, girdle,
white keffeeye, kept in place on the head by a
double rope of goats' hair, and camels' hair
mantle, which many removed. Some came
barefoot, others removed their shoes on entering,
and all sat cross-legged on the divan. The
household servants were Arab peasants (fellahin),
and regarded by the others as of a lower class—tillers,
rather than owners, of the soil. They
were differentiated by wearing turbans, made of
large, coloured handkerchiefs twisted round the
red tarbush, which is of different shape and
manufacture from those worn in the towns.
Two Arab women and the Lady were the sole
representatives of their sex. The guests were
perfectly self-possessed, with none of the <i>mauvaise
honte</i> of such a gathering at home. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
perfectly easy to entertain, and ready to converse
upon any subject, although, we were assured,
less interesting than the natives east of the
Jordan. The Bedu smoked when invited—the
Druses add the prohibition of tobacco to the
Moslem prohibition of wine.</p>

<p>When tea was handed round, the fun of the
evening began. Two of the cakes contained
each a bean, and those who found themselves
possessors of the beans were king and queen
for the evening; obviously a variant of an
original three beans and three kings. The queen
was a young Druse, tall and slim, with good
features, and long, narrow eyes, which gave him
an expression of sleepy good nature; the king
was a much quicker-witted fellah, thick-set, with
a certain piquant ugliness, and bearing the name
of Dieb, which, in Arabic, means "wolf," and
which, whether in Arabic or in German, was,
we were told, equally appropriate.</p>

<p>In true Oriental fashion, the king issued
commands through his wife, and required services
of various kinds from the assembled company,
who cheerfully complied, filled his drinking-bowl
with tea or water as he might desire, fetched
his tobacco, sang to him, and danced for him.
The climax was reached when two of the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
were required to serve the queen for a horse,
and the tall Druse had to proceed up the room
leaning on the shoulders of the two. The
Oriental is a born mime, and the ridiculous
situation was carried off with a <i>savoir faire</i>
which only an entire lack of self-consciousness
could account for. No musical instrument was
at hand, but a little boy, of perhaps twelve, evidently
a known expert, produced an excellent
imitation of the shepherd's pipe by blowing into
his fingers. We were sorry to get none of the
characteristic singing, in which, as in the Hebrides,
a <i>motif</i> is announced by one, and taken up in
chorus by the rest; but the guests came from
different villages, and, therefore, did not know
the same songs—a fact which speaks volumes
for the wealth of folk-songs—a wealth as yet
very imperfectly estimated.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more orderly and
well mannered; the only exception was one of
those which prove the rule. A boy, of perhaps
sixteen, probably from shyness, refused to sing,
upon which he was told to go. "You have had
your <i>Kuchen</i>" (it was quaint to hear the Arab
adoption of the word used among ourselves); "you
have had your tea; you will do nothing—go!"
And go he did, though we were pleased to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
him slip in, half-an-hour later, by another door.
When the king became impatient of his consort's
inertness he started to his feet, tore off his head-dress,
distorted his features, producing the most
entire change in his appearance, and performed
a whole drama in dumb show, which, even to
the uninitiated, was extremely comic, and which
produced shouts of laughter among the Arab
element of the party—the Druse and Bedu
dignity being less easily disturbed.</p>

<p>Arab entertainments are very long drawn out:
when we retired to our rooms, adjoining the
chapel, the party showed no intention of breaking
up. The long-desired rain was a source of
satisfaction, which added to the general placidity,
if not hilarity.</p>

<p>Next morning we awoke to a world of intense
green and blue, glistening with raindrops and
glad with the singing of birds, the bulbul among
the loudest, though it must be owned that, apart
from association, he is much overrated, being
vastly inferior to the nightingale or, to our ears,
the thrush or the blackbird. After an early
breakfast we remounted our horses, and, accompanied
by our host, proceeded upon our interrupted
journey northward.</p>

<p>We noted the little landing-stage, one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
reminiscences of the visit of the German Emperor
to be found all over Palestine—sole representative
of the busy wharves and boat-builders'
yards of the time of our Lord, to which time
belong also the tanneries, potteries, and dyeing-sheds,
the remains of which are scattered around
Et Tâbigha. Farther on we came upon hot
springs, and the, to us, novel sight of a hot
waterfall, with the remains of mills, aqueducts,
and, possibly, baths.</p>

<p>In about half-an-hour we were at Tell Hûm,
which, although no systematic excavation has
yet been possible, is by many authorities assumed
to be identical with Capernaum, and which,
in this belief, was acquired in 1890 by the
Franciscans, who, however, dare not, for political
reasons, call attention for the present to the
elaborate ruins which exist not far beneath the
surface, and the workmanship of which appears
to be Roman. Meantime the soil is under cultivation
for the use of the convent at Tiberias,
a solitary brother remaining there to direct the
labours of the Arabs. The low, swampy ground
is unwholesome for Europeans, and it is necessary
to replace the lonely Franciscan every few months.
The authenticity of the site has been much disputed;
but the cautious Baedeker regards it as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
"as good as certain," largely on the authority
of the old itineraries of pilgrims. Whatever its
name, it was undoubtedly a sacred spot to the
early Christians. The remains include the
foundations of a building of unusual beauty,
constructed of immense blocks of white limestone,
so fine as to resemble marble, which
must have been 75 feet long by 54 wide. The
bases of columns and some very ornate Corinthian
capitals are still visible, and it is not impossible
that we may have here the synagogue built by
the centurion, of whom it was said: "He loveth
our nation!" The ruins, probably of a Christian
church, which were seen here in 600 are not
far distant, and it is evident that a considerable
town once stood here—if not Capernaum then
some other—upon which Romans and Christians
have, in turn, expended wealth and interest.</p>

<p>On our way back to Tiberias, we listened to
many stories illustrating the psychology and beliefs
of the people; of, among other things, the science
and superstitions in regard to the horse—traditions
which deserve to be preserved. In this country,
except where civilisation has introduced bearing-reins,
tail-docking, and other deformities, it is
assumed that Nature understood her own business,
and that, for example, the object of a tail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
was for the relief of a horse when tormented by
flies, for which purpose, as well as for beauty,
the longer and fuller it is the better. They judge
of a horse's age not only by the teeth but by the
tail, which takes some years to bring to perfection.
The first year it is kept bare, the second thinned,
after which it is allowed to grow. The Arabs
preserve the genealogies of all their horses, many
of them up to hundreds of generations, and their
classification is very elaborate. There was a
time when only one horse existed in the country,
and he was the property of Solomon, who,
however, seems to have been imperfect in horsemanship,
as he was, on a certain occasion,
thrown, for which offence against imperial dignity
the horse was condemned to death. He was
ridden down from Jerusalem to Jaffa, weighted
with stones, and sunk into the sea. As he was
in his death agony, five bubbles rose to the
surface, which developed into five horses, each
the ancestor of a separate type (details, as in
the Genesis account of the ancestry of the human
race, not explained). Each of these stems
furnished five sub-families, and from one or
other of these, every pedigree horse is descended.</p>

<p>Another story which illustrated certain characteristics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
of native life, and the possibility of
making the most of occasion, related to a couple
of shechs who came from a great distance to
consult a certain priest in a very delicate matter.
As is the custom of the country, they talked of
irrelevant matters for about four hours, and then
submitted their difficulties. Neither of them
had any children—<i>i.e.</i> possessed no son, but
merely "a piece of a daughter." The phrase
is equivalent to our use in referring to "a head
of cattle." The priest was well known for his
power and benevolence; surely he would exercise
both in so worthy a direction! With characteristic
presence of mind he seized the occasion
for a moral lesson, and represented that certain
changes of habit might be rewarded by the
desired result. The shechs promised obedience,
and departed. A year afterwards, when the
incident was forgotten, the priest called to his
servant one morning to remove a sheep which
had trespassed into his garden, and was informed
that this was a valuable present brought by
one of the shechs upon the occasion of the
arrival of a son and heir. Whether the other
was less fortunate or less grateful history does
not relate.</p>

<p>On our return, we visited the Khan Minyeh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
and a little east of it a small Tell, by some identified
with the site of Bethsaida, which, however,
is by other authorities located on the east side
of the lake. The towns on the shore of Tiberias
have been destroyed, to a degree surprising
when we compare them with contemporary cities
in the Decapolis. In Jerash, in Ammân we were
able to reconstruct the life of the people—their
homes, their temples, their amusements; in
Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, Magdala we
found, at the best, heaps of stones, and mounds
grown over with grass and flowers.</p>

<p>In the absence of Khalil, Dieb, our friend of
the night before, rode back with us to Tiberias,
as, without a local guide, we might have found
it difficult to know whereabouts to ford the many
streams, which a twelve hours' downpour had
swollen to considerable size. He was very
useful and kindly, and filled the Lady's pockets
with pretty shells from the lake, some of which
must have been occupied, as she found two of
them walking about, a month afterwards, in her
hotel in Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_6" id="Foot_6" href="#Ref_6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As an illustration of the esteem in which these acquirements
are held we were told elsewhere the following incident:—A
Franciscan friar, accustomed to ride between the widely-scattered
convents of the order, was, on one occasion, traversing the desert
on a very powerful young horse not yet properly disciplined. The
party met with some Bedu belonging to a rich and powerful tribe,
the shech of which was present. The young horse, possibly taking
fright, or excited by the presence of the Arab mares always ridden
by the Bedu, became violent, and tore off across the sands. The
Franciscan, a very small man, and hampered by his habit, nevertheless
retained his self-possession and his seat, and, in course of
time, brought the animal back to obedience. The shech watched
every manœuvre with the deepest interest, and when the priest
returned to the party congratulated him very cordially, and offered
him his daughter in marriage. It was explained that he was a
priest. "I don't mind that," said the shech; "he is just the son-in-law
for me." But the priest was poor. "No matter, he shall
have her without payment of so much as a single camel. I have
two daughters; he shall choose between them: he shall be to me
as a son." History goes no further.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Of</span>
the town of Tiberias the less said the
better, though it should be admitted that
we saw it under exceptional circumstances—after
twelve hours' steady rain, for which it is
certainly not adapted. Most of the streets are
stone tunnels, where, when it once enters, the
water stands in large pools unaffected by sun
or wind, and with only islands of decaying
matter, animal and vegetable, to serve as steps
for hapless pedestrians. In the open streets the
inhabitants, with a view to protection from sun,
have rigged up coverings of old mats, old carpets,
old clothes, which, naturally, shed unsavoury
drippings upon our heads as we passed beneath.
The exquisite cleanliness and brightness of our
convent quarters tempted us to stay within, and
enjoy the glorious view of lake and mountain
from the roof; but we resisted, and were well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
rewarded for our walk up to the Scottish
hospital by the sight of good work well and
scientifically done, of missionaries who follow
in the footsteps of their Master, who has left
us but one sermon, and countless instances of
work among the sick and the needy. Of the
Scottish and American missions in Palestine
the English visitor can feel justly proud, if not
of his race, at least of those who speak his
tongue.</p>

<p>The remainder of our time in Tiberias was
spent, not in the world of the Old or New
Testaments, or even of the Crusaders, but in the
first six centuries <small>A.D.</small>, when the Jews had forgotten
their original hatred of its novelty and its
ceremonial uncleanness, and had accepted it, with
Jerusalem, Safed, and Hebron, as one of their
four holy cities; had established a theological
university, and built over a dozen synagogues.
As at the universities of Europe in the Middle
Ages, students would come and attach themselves
to this or that teacher, sitting at his feet in his
own house, or listening to his discussions with
other Gamaliels in public places. It is probable
that Christ never came to this city; and, indeed,
all its personal associations are of a later period.
Here Josephus had a powerful stronghold during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
the Jewish wars; here, after the destruction of
Jerusalem, we find the Sanhedrin; here, testifying
to the strength and progress of Christianity,
the opposition school of the Talmud was
established; here the Mishna, the collection of
ancient tradition, was published in 200 <small>A.D.</small>; here,
some four hundred years later, the so-called
Jerusalem Talmud; here the now accepted
pointing of the Hebrew Bible came into existence—in
fact, it is the cradle of Jewish literature and
learning. Its Christian associations are few.
There were bishops of Tiberias in the fifth
century; but their flocks must have been small,
and the bishopric died out, to be revived by the
Crusaders. It was here that St Jerome learned
Hebrew, in preparation for his work upon the
Vulgate.</p>

<p>We picked our way among the pools, as best
we could, to the outside of the city, and up the
hill westward, asking our way to the tombs of
various learned rabbis from the Jews whom we
met on the road, but who, unless they were
silent from suspicion, seemed but little acquainted
with the shrines of Maimonides, the philosopher,
Rab Jochanan Ben Sakai, or even with the celebrated
Rabbi Akiba, who took so prominent a
part in the revolt of Bar Cochba, whose claims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
to be the Messiah he supported with a zeal which
led to the ultimate destruction of the last remnant
of the Jewish kingdom in 135.</p>

<p>We found the graves of the great Talmudist
Rabbi Meîr and two of his pupils in a school of
the Ashkenazim, which, for the nonce, was serving
a very useful purpose as hospice for a number of
German Jews travelling to a new colony farther
south. They had spread their mattresses all over
the dais, and were eating a meal which had the
characteristic Jewish smell of fish and onions.</p>

<p>Of course, also, we visited the celebrated hot
baths, which lie about a mile to the south of the
town, in the neighbourhood of the old city, as is
testified by the columns, capitals, and hewn stones
scattered in every direction. The road seems to
follow the lines of an old colonnade, to judge from
the numerous bases of pillars gradually wearing
away under the friction of carriage wheels. The
water has a temperature of 143 degrees Fahrenheit,
and even in the open air we found it impossible
to endure the warmth of a little spring
which gushed out from the hillside with a very
unpleasant sulphurous smell. There are two
general bath-houses, in one of which private baths
may be had. These are much frequented, and
seem to be very effectual in cases of rheumatism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
and cutaneous disease, though, perhaps, less so
than those at Callirhoe, east of the Jordan, of
which marvellous, and apparently authentic, cures
are related.</p>

<p>After one more night in Tiberias we set out
at an early hour next morning on our way to
Besan, from whence we proposed to visit Pella,
and, crossing the Jordan, return down its eastern
bank. It was a very easy ride, of about eight
hours, along a good road, with fertile fields, greensward,
and abundant trees and bushes to refresh
the eye; but as it lies, for the most part, six
hundred feet below sea-level, one may well
imagine that it is, as reported, later in the
season intolerably hot. In strange contrast to
the almost tropical vegetation, the palms and bananas,
the oleanders and azaleas, were the great
snow-covered shoulders of the Jebel es-Shech,
the Mountain of the Shech, the highest point
of Mount Hermon, dominating the landscape,
and visible, whenever we looked backward, for
the greater part of the day.</p>

<p>We were much interested in a Jewish family
which accompanied us for some distance on their
way to the colony. The mother, grasping an
infant, was perilously balanced upon the top of
the family bedding, beneath which the legs of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
mule were barely visible; while an older child, of
perhaps three, hung in a wooden box, accompanied
by several gas-tins, on one side of a donkey,
balanced on the other by the family wardrobe.
The men were afoot, and generally in the rear,
unless some displacement of the baggage or a
specially deep ford seemed to require some attention
on their part. The child seemed quite confident
and happy, although the donkey, less heavily
weighted than the mule, was generally far ahead,
with the object of accumulating leisure for the
snatching of a meal wherever specially tempting
thistles invited.</p>

<p>We lunched at Jisr el Mujamia, where a temporary
village of tents and wooden huts had been
erected for those employed on the new railway—engineers,
fellahin, workmen, and soldiers. The
River Jordan, which we had been following almost
ever since we left the Lake of Tiberias, here
divided into several parallel streams, leaving a
number of islands, now grown over with bushes
and herbage, but probably covered when the
river is full. A quaint stone bridge, with very
acute arches, leading to a village, lent human
interest to the scene; and on the hills beyond we
were shown the site of the town of Gadara, just
south of the Yarmuk, one of the principal tributaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
of the Jordan. Here, also, are hot springs,
much visited in the season, and the ruins of
another of the Græco-Roman cities which encircle
the lake, although considerably older than the
Herodian city of Tiberias. We were constantly
brought face to face with anomalies and anachronisms;
but it is, nevertheless, a shock to
one's preconceived ideas to turn from the busy
scene in the immediate foreground—the skilful
engineering of the new railway—to cross, in
imagination, the Roman bridge, to pass the poor
fellahin village, type, with its contrasting railway,
of the civilisation of to-day, up to where, on
yonder height, it is not difficult to call up, on their
old sites, the amphitheatre of Gadara looking
up the lake, the acropolis above, the triumphal
archway, the Greek villas scattered on the hills
to catch the breeze, the barracks of the Roman
legions, whence the troops descended daily to the
cities around. These were what met the eyes
of Jesus when He wandered among yonder
tombs and met the poor madman whose diseased
imagination conceived himself to be one of the
legions whom he daily looked upon in all their
bravery of sheen and colour. And now the
fellahin are storing their grain in sculptured
sarcophagi; for the grave outlasts all, even its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
occupants, and the graceful wreaths which did
honour to some centurion over two thousand
years ago still bloom immortally among the haste
and squalor, the railways, the canvas tents, the
wooden huts, the crumbling villages, the competition
of to-day. Beyond the Jordan, with all
its associations, at the foot of the hills which
have looked on at so many cycles of change, the
wounded earth yawned and gaped, awaiting the
iron road which was to carry her children yet
more rapidly to the end, which now, as of old,
awaits us all. This eastern Nature, so full of the
past, is seldom glad—has, except in her wildest
utterances, little of the joy which Wordsworth
found in the simpler revelations of our English
hills—but the complication of ancient leisureliness
by modern haste, of cycles of repose by the scars
of modern science, is to add irony to melancholy,
cynicism to meditation, to exhibit decay where
she reveals only repose, to force utterance where
she has offered us the music of songs unsung.</p>

<p>We were almost glad to turn away; and soon
the scene was changed. As we continued our
way due south we only now and then caught
glimpses of the Jordan, although we crossed
many streams hastening down with their little
contributions to the historic whole. All was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
fresh and green; we mounted, perhaps, some
300 feet, and the plain widened out into the
valley of Jezreel, and we found the air fresh
and pleasant, although when we reached Besan
we were still 320 feet below sea-level. We
were free to enjoy the green earth and the blue
sky without complication of historical associations,
except when, about two hours after leaving our
halting-place, we saw on a hill to our right a
village now known as Kôkab el-Hawa, where
King Fulke built a castle, known by the familiar
name of Belvoir, and which was taken by Salah ed-din
in 1188. We resisted the temptation to
climb, although there are ruins to photograph,
and it is said that the outlook deserves its name.</p>

<p>The approach to the town of Besan is truly
surprising; and, indeed, the appearance of the
whole neighbourhood is unique in Palestine, owing
to the taste and activity of the mudir, who, it is
whispered, remains here for political reasons, and
who has had the good sense to make his exile
as attractive as possible. The town lies in a
green hollow, sloping westward towards the
low-lying plain of Jezreel, some 300 feet below.
The winding stream of the Jalûd waters it on
the north, and streams flow abundantly in all
directions. The hills to the north appear to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
of volcanic formation; and, indeed, most of the
rocks scattered about, seemed to be basalt. An
excellent road approaches the town, bordered for
some distance by well-planted trees, though we
could not help observing what must be very
discouraging to the æsthetic mudir, that, despite
all pains taken for their security, they had been
wantonly mishandled. The main street might
well be called a boulevard. It is wide, planted
mainly with acacias and the graceful azedarach
(Pride of India), and the houses are stone, and
mainly of two storeys. A great archway, flanked
on either side by magnificent ancient Corinthian
pillars, leads into the village khan, a large open
space, surrounded on three sides by stables and
outhouses; while on the fourth is the inn itself,
the upper storey, reserved for guests of the better
class, being approached by an outside staircase.
Here we found a large hall, furnished only by
low stools, and some cupboards containing the
wine and arak, theoretically eschewed by Moslem
guests; while various sleeping-rooms opened into
a corridor beyond. Here we immediately secured
the requisite accommodation, which was
so far of a superior kind that it included bedsteads,
as well as a table and a couple of chairs.
Experience led us at a later hour to reject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
bedsteads, curtains, and bedclothes, and to sleep
upon a mattress and <i>lehaf</i> (wadded cotton quilt)
upon the floor, supplemented by our own wraps.</p>

<p>We snatched a hurried meal, for we were
occupied with certain ambitious projects, which
absorbed our attention. Our dream—or, at
all events, that of the Lady and the Doctor—the
Artist preferred highroads and hotels—was
to descend down the east bank of the Jordan,
crossing the fords of Bethabara, and lunching at
Pella, and thence to make our way through the
desert to Jericho, a two days' journey, but a far
more attractive prospect than a commonplace
return <i>via</i> Nablûs, along a road we already knew,
and which had long been vulgarised by the
"Personally Conducted." The greatest attraction
of all was, that, in the absence of villages, and
having no tents, we should have to pass a night
with the Meshalcha Bedu, who, we were told,
were at this time encamped north of the Jabbok.
They are a rich and powerful sept, belonging to
the Beni Hasan, and their district lies about the
tomb of the great Moslem general, Abu Obeidah
Ibn el Jerrâh, of the time of Omar (<i>c.</i> 650). We
were so very fortunate as to carry introductions
from Dr Schumacher, who is, perhaps, better
known east of the Jordan than any other European,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
and whose relations with the Bedu, as well
as with the fellahin, are very different from those
of the many who have been only unfortunate in their
dealings with the natives. We were delighted
at our prospects, and pictured ourselves listening
to songs and folklore, gathered round a camp
fire in the moonlight, pouring libations of coffee
to the spirit of Shech Shadli, the originator of
the beverage, giving up our revolvers in token
of confidence in our hosts, looking on at the sword-dances
of the young men, exchanging confidences
with the women, and finally sleeping under a
roof of camels' hair, upon priceless carpets and
under silken coverlets.</p>

<p>To achieve this we must go in state, and the
main thing was to enlarge our retinue, which
consisted at present of the somewhat ragged
Khalil, by the addition of a soldier, who would
receive orders to make all the demands which
were in accordance with our dignity—a fact not
patent to the naked eye, but which the mudir
instructed by our kind friend the American
Consul, would doubtless accept. First we had
to find the mudir, who was not at his own house,
a fine modern building with large garden adorned
with antique busts, and not at the serai (court-house),
but who was finally discovered making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
his afternoon devotions at the mosque. He
was good enough to emerge with a train of attendants,
a dignified man of middle age, carefully
read the letter addressed to him, and assured
us, in passable French, that our request should
receive attention, and that the soldier would be
at our service at six o'clock next morning.</p>

<p>We were then free to visit the sites which were
the main object of our journey to Besan. The
name Besan, which we now associate with the
most beautiful city in Palestine, had for us at
first no associations, and we did not feel any
great excitement even when told that it was a
strong and walled city in the time of Joshua,
that the inhabitants had chariots of iron, which
might well be used on the surrounding plain,
nor even that it was to the wall of Beth-shean,
as it was then called, that the bodies of Saul
and his three sons were nailed, his armour being
hung up as an offering in the temple of Astarte.
But as we pursued our inquiries, the story of
the city gained in interest. Thothmes III. must
have passed through it when he overthrew one
hundred and eighteen cities in Palestine, as it
stands on the highway between Egypt and
Damascus; it is mentioned in Egyptian literature
in the fourteenth century <small>B.C.</small>; the Israelites found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
it impregnable; Holofernes, Pompey, Salah
ed-din, occupied it, possibly also Tiglath-pileser
and Sargon. Josephus calls it the richest city of
the Decapolis, the only one west of the Jordan.
In his time it was called Scythopolis, and it is
one of the very few examples of reversion from
the Greek to the older name. On the coins
(Nero to Gordian), and by classical authors, the
town is called Nysa, and the effigy on the coin
is that of the nymph suckling Bacchus; but the
present name, corrupted from Beth-Sha'an, possibly
the <i>house</i> (<i>beit</i>) of some pagan divinity, has
been used since the Crusades.</p>

<p>Lastly, for the Christian, Besan has its special
interest, as having been one of the places where,
under Decius and Diocletian, the amphitheatres
were used for the cruel slaughter not of wild
beasts alone, but of the confessors of Christ.
When we stood gazing at the majestic amphitheatre,
with its twelve basalt benches for spectators,
nearly two hundred feet in diameter, we
imagined the Christian gladiator looking over the
sea of heads which surrounded him to where
the blue sky, and the blue hills of Gilead, gave
promise of something which should endure when
even yonder citadel, frowning to the north, had
crumbled in decay. Delicate ferns and flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
now shroud the entrance to the dark passages
leading to the dens, where one may still see the
iron rings to which the beasts were chained;
and in the recesses in which brass sounding-tubes
facilitated the hearing of the roar of anger and
the shriek of pain, swallows are darting in and
out to chirping nestlings, impatient for their food.</p>

<p>We failed to find the hippodrome, said to lie
west of the village, but now concealed by vegetation.
The lines of a fine colonnade are easily
traced, leading along the brook to an ancient
bridge, beyond which is a street, and near by
a massive fort; north of this a reservoir, known
as El Hammâm, obviously the site of Roman
baths. Everywhere are columns, capitals, hewn
stones. North of the great amphitheatre a Tell
cries out for excavation, the massive wall and
the great portal which once enclosed its summit
being clearly traceable. Everywhere, in the hills
beyond, are tombs, many with fine painting and
sculpture. Where can the archæologist find richer
promise? There is, happily, a rumour that it is
one of the many sites likely to be taken in hand
by German skill and perseverance. The very
fact that Besan is, at least for the present, well
out of the tourist track has preserved the ancient,
perhaps also the modern, city, from exploitation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
Unfortunately, the railroad will soon be here,
and who knows how long this beautiful city
may escape all the influences which have corrupted
and vulgarised Jerusalem?</p>

<p>Besan is at present purely Moslem: there are
a few Christian inhabitants, mainly of the Greek
Church, who seek occasional spiritual pabulum in
Tiberias, only eight hours away, and who seem
to enjoy equal rights with, and even to share
some of the beliefs of, their neighbours. We saw,
for example, a very interesting wely, which, like
so many, if not most, in Syria, is resorted to by
those of all creeds. It was, as usual, very difficult
to obtain any exact information as to its
history and origin. The tomb, apparently of a
giant of ten feet or so, is a massive stone structure
enclosed with a rough stone wall and surrounded
by trees. The derwish in charge lives close by.
The tomb and enclosure are decorated with
numerous small flags, mainly white, the offerings
of the faithful. We managed—not without difficulty—to
photograph it secretly, both from within
and without. We could only ascertain that it
was sacred to a certain Bishop Jochanan, who,
although our informants were somewhat confused
as to details, seems to have been an apostate
from Christianity, and a miracle-worker. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
wely serves purposes other than religious. It is
much resorted to for the healing of the sick and
for obtaining special boons; but it is also supplementary
to the serai, and saves many a lawsuit,
as an oath made upon the tomb must be accepted
as final, and he would be a very foolhardy man
who would lie to the saint, whatever might be
the degree of his reverence for the Almighty!
Every Moslem tomb (exclusive, naturally, of
those of women, who are a mere accident in the
course of nature) is surmounted by two stones,
for the accommodation of the good and bad
angels respectively, who testify as to his conduct;
one at least of these is of the shape of the fez or
tarbush, which was the characteristic sign of faith
and nationality during life. In the present case
this feature is exaggerated in proportion to the
size of the tomb, so that the whole roughly
resembles the outline of a horse, the tarbush
being taken for the head. The suspected culprit,
or other person about to swear, sits astride, and
makes oath accordingly. The saint is, moreover,
the peacemaker in feuds, and the most persistent
cases of blood-revenge must be abandoned when
the opponents have shaken hands across the
tomb. A man who here denies or confesses a
crime receives judgment accordingly, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
further evidence. There seemed to be traces
upon the doorposts of recent sacrifices, with
the usual accompaniment of anointing with
blood.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing that we saw upon our ride
surprised us more than the information that a
large and handsome stone house in the town
belonged to a Bedawy shech—a shech of shechs.
One would have supposed that such a possession
violated every instinct and tradition of his race,
for we had once been present when an elderly
Bedu, who had been forced by politeness to
accept hospitality in a house for the first time,
had sat in terror of what might happen, gun in
hand. We sought in vain to account for such an
anomaly. "Is he very rich?" we inquired, on
the hypothesis that some crisis of agricultural
depression had driven him to a more permanent
investment. "Rich?" said our informant; "he
can be as rich as he likes. Is he not the shech
above all other shechs of the district? He
wants a house, a camel, a tent? He takes it.
He wants a wife—he may have had already
twenty-nine. He takes my sister, my daughter,
but he does not pay for her. It is not difficult
for him to be rich."</p>

<p>Nay, truly,</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, of course, this is quite another matter from
the oppression of the poor, the rack-renting, the
evictions, the unequal taxation, the results of free
trade, the hunger and misery of great cities, the
depopulation of villages, which are carried on
in an orderly and properly organised fashion
farther West.</p>

<p>We would have gladly lingered in this beautiful
spot, surely the garden of Palestine, so great a
contrast to the aridity of Judæa, which Mark
Twain has somewhat severely described as
"leagues of blighted, blasted, sandy, rocky, sunburnt,
ugly, dreary, infamous country." We are
apt to look upon the Jews as a utilitarian and
money-loving people. Surely, however, nowhere
on earth can we find a race whom sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
and religion have so influenced in the
choice and love of home. We Europeans do
not realise that the great King Solomon, who
reigned over a people "like the dust of the
earth in multitude," and whose wealth made
"silver to be nothing accounted of," had for
empire part of a kingdom the size of Wales;
and that, allowing all that one may for change
of agricultural conditions, his capital was situated
in its most unprofitable and one of its least
attractive districts—six hours' ride from the
nearest river, of which the average width was
eighty feet; a district without a harbour, on
the way to nowhere, out of reach of all the
great roads of commerce and intercommunication
of nations. Jerusalem owes her origin and
continuance entirely to the heart and not the
brain of man. She is the creation of the
prophet, the priest, the dreamer. The mere
statesman, agriculturist, sanitarian—humanitarian,
even—would have none of her. Even to-day
she survives only as a matter of sacred association.
Take away her sanctuaries, her convents,
and her tourists, and nothing would be left but
the German colony—which could not remain
without customers for its shops, or even maintain
its institutions—and the Jews, who live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
mainly on the charity of Europe. Agriculture,
Jewish and German, would continue in the
plains; philanthropy, Scottish and American, in
Galilee and Syria; education and culture,
American and Jesuit, in Beirut; commerce,
German and Jewish, in Jaffa and Haifa; but all
these exist independently of, almost in spite of,
Jerusalem, and have been created for the advantage
of mankind.</p>

few things in the East fulfil adequately
the purposes for which they are intended,
and we were not at all surprised when the soldier,
who arrived punctually at six o'clock next morning,
and who had many graces, and possibly all the
virtues, appeared mounted on a horse utterly
unfit for the fatiguing journey we contemplated.
We accordingly despatched him back to the serai,
with thanks and compliments, and a message to
the effect that we should prefer a better article.
These little matters consume a great deal of time,
and a proportionate amount of bad language, and
to economise the one, and avoid the other, we
went for a walk. Our kindly companion, who had
been for some years a dispenser in the Scottish
hospital in Tiberias, seemed to think there would
be no objection to a trespass into the grounds of
the mudir's private house, and obligingly lent a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
hand while we collected the antique busts which
were dispersed about his garden, and arranged
them on garden seats with a view to photography.
It is not every day one comes across half-a-dozen
perfect specimens of Greek art never photographed
before; and so obliging an amateur of
beauty as the mudir had proved himself, would
assuredly have understood and pardoned our
temptation had he been up, which (perhaps
happily, as some element of doubt remained)
he was not. We then walked somewhat farther,
feasted our eyes once more upon all the pleasant
things of Besan, classical and modern, and when
on our return we still found the incompetent
steed tied up at the entrance to our khan, we
wandered off to the serai, and finally possessed
ourselves of an alternative soldier, although with
some suspicion that this time it was the man, and
not the horse, who was incompetent.</p>

<p>Neither Khalil nor the Artist had a high
opinion of the plan cherished by the Lady and
the Doctor—one feared scarcity of barley for
the horses, the other of the amenities of civilisation
for herself. The Artist, however, could not
speak Arabic, so if there were any collusion with
the officer it could only have been on the part of
Khalil. We had not, however, gone far from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
Besan, only far enough to be beyond reach of
appeal, when we were presented with a series
of pictures of the impossibilities ahead. No
one knew where the Meshalcha Bedu were at
present encamped—the place where they would
undoubtedly be found was quite beyond a day's
journey; we had started too late (it was already
eight o'clock) to venture on so great a risk; it
was not certain how we should be received.
The consequences to ourselves were painted in
vivid colours, but all these observations had for
us an interest that was merely psychological and
linguistic, as exhibiting the way in which the
Arab mind worked. The Arab imagination was
not daunted, however, and the next shot told.
The fords of the Jordan would be impassable—had
we not seen how full the Jalûd was, had
not the little stream we had even now crossed
reached to the knees of the horses, had not all
the streams been drinking away there up in the
hills, where Allah had so lately sent us the blessing
of rain? The Lady and the Doctor looked
guiltily at each other. The one put confidence
in Sadowi, the other in his own inches; but if
they should find they had inveigled the Artist
into floating down the Jordan with not so much
as an insurance upon her kodak! The Lady,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
somewhat disingenuously, began to enlarge
upon the prospect of visiting Pella, in hope of
extracting an expression of desire, which might
be quotable in case of emergency; but her friend
showed no enthusiasm for Greek cities, declined
to endorse ravings over early Christian refugees,
and asked if any other way were shorter.
Khalil's honour was appealed to, as to the
veracity of the soldier's allegations. He swore
upon his beard, which he did not possess, and
upon his eyes, of which only one was in working
order, upon his head and his heart, that the thing
was impossible.</p>

<p>What were we to do? Go meekly back to
Besan, abandon all our prospects, our tent of
many poles (we had been assured that we must
not think of entering one with less than three,
and that our dignity really required even more),
our tattooed ladies with the trains of their dresses
in front, our stately shech, who would undoubtedly
kill a sheep and bake cakes for us, like the
patriarchs did when they had guests—return to
the banalities of Nablûs, where children asked
for backsheesh, and finally ride home along a
commonplace highroad to Jerusalem?</p>

<p>"When the tale of bricks is doubled Moses
comes," say the Arabs—and the soldier had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
an idea. We were to descend the banks of the
Jordan on the west side. We had been assured
that no one ever did this, that the district was
very wild, and even lawless, and that the few
Bedu we might chance to meet were such as we
should not care to house with. However, we
had our soldier, who looked effective (at a
distance), and was bristling with weapons, and
it would be quite interesting to sleep in the
desert, light a fire to keep off wild beasts, and
take turns to mount guard, like a boys' story book.
Apparently, however, it need not come to this.
Somewhere in the wilderness was a serai, a
little fortress or Government building, which
existed for the accommodation of tax-collectors,
and there we could, no doubt, find shelter. We
were somewhat inclined to believe that the
whole thing was "a put-up job," arranged before
we left, and that our soldier's journey was being
utilised for conveying despatches, or more, probably,
messages, from the parent Government
establishment in Besan. However, we could
only submit; had we persisted, our leader was
not so unintelligent as not to see that his
prophecies were fulfilled, and we wheeled round,
and turned off to the south-east, fairly content
with our prospects after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
We had followed the west side of the Jordan
from the Sea of Tiberias to Besan, and now we
were to follow it down to its fall into the Dead
Sea—65 miles in all. Our path lay in the deep
valley between the hills of Gilead on the east
and the hills of Samaria and Judæa on the west—a
valley which the Arabs very suitably call <i>El-Ghor</i>—<i>i.e.</i>
The Rift. It varies in width from 6
or 7 miles in the district of Besan to about 3
for some 13 miles alongside the hills of Samaria,
widening by slow degrees till near Jericho,
when it stretches out into a plain, as at Besan.
The river winds and twists deep down at the
bottom, its course marked all the way by an
exuberant fertility, often extending for some
distance east and west, showing where tributary
streams are hastening down from the watersheds
above. We rode, for the most part, upon
somewhat higher ground, on terraces of land at
the foot, or on the side of, the hills, as the case
might be, and were often able to look down into
this deep hollow of vivid green, reminding us,
in exaggerated form, as so much in this land
is exaggerated, of a north country ghyll. To
realise its depth one has to remember that it is
deeper below the earth's surface than an average
coal mine, that it is really an old sea-bottom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
and that the rapidity of the stream, falling at
first 40 feet in a mile, accounts for the weird
forms of washed-out mounds of earth, for the
exposed tree roots, for the heaps of débris of all
kinds. The name of the Jordan is not composed
of the two names Jor and Dan, as the early
pilgrims so ingeniously conjectured, but means,
appropriately, the "downcomer."</p>

<p>For some distance, all around and below
Besan, there are abundant signs of extreme
fertility. In ancient times it was noted for
corn, dates, balsam, flax, and sugar-cane. The
edicts of Diocletian refer to its trade in linen,
and Vespasian settled his troops in this district
as one capable of bearing a large additional
population. In the course of the morning we
crossed over a score of streams, and many
remains of aqueducts showed how, in old days,
they had been turned to the utmost account
for irrigation. When we had passed but a few
miles beyond Besan, we lost all traces of human
habitation, although not of human handiwork,
for wide patches of well-cultivated land testified
that, like the Israelites of old, the hill population
only comes down to sow, guard, and reap its
harvests. Indeed, for the greater part of the
year the Ghor would be uninhabitable. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
hothouse vegetation implies also a hothouse
climate; its swamps are beautiful but malarious;
its streams are valuable for irrigation but death-dealing
to drink, impregnated with chlorides and
sodium, and rank with decaying vegetable matter.</p>

<p>From time to time we came across small
groups of Bedawy tents, mainly of a humble
kind, although now and then a tent of three
poles, with a lance planted at the doorway,
testified to the presence of a shech. Within
but a short distance we were certain to find
large flocks of lambs, white and woolly, a rare
sight to us, accustomed only to the goats capable
of enduring the aridity of the Jerusalem district,
and familiar with sheep only as household pets,
sharing equally with the cat and the water-pipe.
The problem which at first presented
itself was: What had become of all the mothers?
The answer was generally found a mile or so
farther on, in some green spot, whither they had
been driven for pasture, to be brought back
later, to the safety of the camp, and the needs of
their nurslings.</p>

<p>It seemed to us that we now and then climbed
hills for the sake of descending them, and that
more than once we went across country to return
to the neighbourhood of the point from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
we started; but, after all, it is difficult to judge
of distances with only distant mountains for
landmarks, and one part of such a valley as the
Ghor is very much like another. We were to
lunch beside the Wady Mâlih, the first stream
on this part of our journey suitable alike for
horse and man, but the wady was long in
coming. At intervals we inquired as to its
whereabouts, and were always told it was <i>ba'ad
wahad saar</i>—"after half-an-hour"—and after
about four half-hours, when the horses were getting
somewhat weary, and our eyes ached from the
glare of the sand, we entered a narrow valley,
a wonderful garden of loveliness. For some
time we had seen no animal life except lizards,
an occasional jerboa (a pretty little miniature
kangaroo), and occasional birds of prey—ravens,
eagles, and griffon-vultures—flying high in the
heavens towards some horse or camel, dead or
dying. Here, at the very entrance of the valley,
we disturbed innumerable pairs of busy little
chats, among the daintiest of the bird creation
(<i>saxicola libanotica</i>); and, almost equally graceful
as to outline, although of a reddish-brown colour,
like a robin, the little desert larks, which chattered
rather than sang, as they hovered over the
tangle of bulrushes and sedge-grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
Now and then we saw a gorgeous kingfisher,
blue as sapphires, turquoises—blue as the sky itself.
A little later we should probably have
found storks, "the father of legs" as the Arabs
call them, who arrive in the early spring in immense
numbers, and add to the general fairy-tale
effect of this country. The stream was concealed
by a thicket of verdure, bordered, on
slightly higher ground, by oleanders and willows,
above them a belt of white poplars and tamarisks;
while the steep, sloping banks were clothed with
the bushes of the graceful capers, just coming
into leaf, rival, in Palestine, of our own wild
rose; while everywhere chrysanthemums, ornithogalums,
scented stocks, hawkweeds, and centaureas
promised abundance of colour if we
would but await their coming.</p>

<p>We clamoured for an immediate halt—where
could we find so inviting a spot?—but our attendants
turned a deaf ear, and pressed on,
gradually mounting to higher ground, and leaving
our beautiful, but probably malarious, swamp behind.
We dismounted finally on a little knoll
crowned with trees, the stream, now clear of
foliage, and accessible for the horses, winding
about its foot, and a gay little waterfall making
music for us beyond. Here we lunched and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
rested, and then we had an illustration, characteristic
of this country, of the wild-beast habits
of the Arab. We are well accustomed to the
fact that real solitude is here, in an ordinary
way, impossible. You may scan the horizon,
and see no sign of humanity for miles, but within
a few minutes a picturesque Arab is beside
you, asking impudently for backsheesh, insinuating
that the hour is propitious for the
smoking of tobacco, or offering you water or
milk, according to the degree of his association
with the improving influences of European civilisation.
In the desert the Arab is still a gentleman,
and the little group which suddenly appeared
within a few feet of us—though for a dozen
miles at least we had not seen so much
humanity as might be implied by the presence
of a single goat—offered no incivility, although
they were mainly women, and therefore, as a
rule, inferior in courtesy to the men. They did
not even stare unduly; in fact, not half so much
as we did at them. It is a curious and invariable
fact that here, Arabs spring out of the earth, like
London boys at an accident.</p>

<p>We did not feel entire confidence in our
cicerone, as such; and as it was already late we
dared not linger, and by three o'clock we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
mounted our horses, forded the Mâlih, and,
mounting the steep acclivity beyond, found ourselves
on high ground, which is the watershed for
the innumerable wadys which wander down to
the sinuous Jordan on our left. Hence we could
look back to the hoary head of the Jebel es-Shech,
of Mount Hermon, and forward to the
Jebel Osha in the Belka; while on the hither
side a break in the hills showed where the river
Jabbok, another old friend of our last ride, was
working its winding way down to the Jordan.
If we had but known it—such information being
far from the thoughts and interests of our escort,
even had they known it themselves—we ought
to have turned aside some four hours later to
see the caverns of Makhrûd, which are, so far
as we can learn, valuable alike to the geologist,
and to the student of natural history.</p>

<p>However, we kept on our way, on somewhat
high ground, till we entered a fertile valley, tending
gradually to the south-east, and which our
escort saluted with joy as the Wady Faria, in
which our quarters for the night were situated.
Here, <i>ba'ad wahad sa'a</i>—"after one hour"—we
should be at the end of our journey. Well-cultivated
fields surrounded us, and even climbed
the hill beyond, evidences of the existence of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
population which remained invisible: not a tent,
not a single human being was in sight. We
descended yet deeper, the hour passed, and yet
another, and we found ourselves in a wide plain,
which we crossed to the eastward. "Ba'ad nus
sâ'a" was now the promise—"after half-an-hour";
varied after yet another hour by "ba'ad chamseh
sâ'a"—"after a quarter of an hour." Our
guide had clearly gone too far west, and had
struck the wady at the point farthest from our
destination. The twilight fell, and it was then
clearly evident that we had lost our way. The
soldier had the sense to follow the stream, as
likely to conduct us ultimately to our destination;
but we had lost the path, and it was sorely
rough riding. Darkness descended with true
Oriental abruptness; moon there was none, and
clouds obscured the stars. Suddenly Sadowi,
who was foremost, declined to move, and the
Artist's horse stumbled; the men got off, and felt
the ground. We were on the edge of a precipice,
the horses were already entangled in the
rough brushwood, a perpendicular wall rose to
our right—to turn back was impossible. The
ladies dismounted, and placed themselves on a
ledge of rock, out of the way of the uneasy
horses. Khalil, afraid for the safety of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
animals, broke forth into violent abuse of the
soldier, whose curses, in return, were not loud
but deep. The Doctor commanded silence, some
of which he utilised for the expression of his
own opinions. After much searching, in all the
wrong places, some candles were produced, and
lighted, upon which the rain most unexpectedly
descended in torrents, and put them out. Anything,
however, seemed better than inaction: two
of us finally contrived, by means of holding the
candles within our cloaks to shed enough light
in front of us, to make some kind of progress;
while the soldier with another went ahead.
Khalil followed with the five horses, who picked
their way with their usual cleverness, unencumbered
except by saddle-bags, which now and
then caught upon the bushes, and were disengaged
with a jerk which would have reduced
anything, but goats' hair, to rags. We contrived,
somehow, to reach the top of the bank, and were
much cheered to see, a mile or so ahead of us,
a flickering light, and to hear the barking of
dogs—always a welcome sound when one is in
the dark and far from shelter. After half-an-hour
of very rough scrambling we found ourselves
again upon a path, which conducted us
direct to the welcome light. This we found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
to proceed from a great fire in the midst
of a Bedawy camp—a weird spectacle in such
surroundings. We were challenged at various
points by their scouts: <i>shislu?</i>—"Who goes
there"; but, fortunately, the reply: <i>sahib</i>—"A
friend"—appeared to be satisfactory. When we
came into the camp we were immediately surrounded
by the inquiring population, who offered
no discourtesy; all the same, we considered it
wise to keep an eye upon the contents of our
saddle-bags. The open space was encumbered
with cows and sheep, and the glare of an immense
bonfire added to our bewilderment. The
children and women gathered round us, and
touched our clothes, though with far more gentleness
than would be shown in London to, say,
a group of Australian natives—and we must
have seemed not less strange to our new
friends. The serai was yet far, they averred,
the night was dark, the road was rough; would
we not remain with them? We escaped their
kindly importunity with what grace we could,
and left Khalil to bargain for a guide—a process
quite as characteristically grasping as their would-be
hospitality was characteristically liberal. Khalil
offered a bishlik (6d.); they held out for four
piasters (8d.); finally a compromise was effected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
upon a bishlik and a packet of tobacco. We
may remark that when, at the end of the drama,
we produced the tobacco from our stores Khalil
intercepted the gift, and stipulated that it should
not be bestowed till the Bedu, whose activity had
been stimulated at the sight of so unwonted a
luxury, had helped him to water the horses. We
were soon picking our way among ruins too dark
to distinguish, but which we believe to have been
those of the ancient Archelais, erected by Herod
Archelaus, the son of Herod the Great. Before
long we were on a good path; the rain stopped,
the stars came out, the Lady remounted her
horse, and the spirits of the party rose again.
Soon we were cheered by the steady gleam of
a stationary light, and finally we clattered over
a bridge and under a great gateway, and found
ourselves in the court of the serai.</p>

<p>We received a friendly welcome from a
gigantic negro, and were at once shown into
a large room, with windows high up near the
roof, and a door opening into the courtyard,
around three sides of which the house was
built; while the fourth was enclosed with a
wall the height of the building, with a strong
iron-clad door—everything, apparently, being
arranged with a view to security. An official,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
said to be the lawyer or secretary of the establishment,
politely vacated the guest-room on
our behalf. Our saddle-bags were brought in,
and, well content with shelter and the prospect
of food, we prepared to make our arrangements
for the night, our room being already not ill-furnished,
all things considered, with a large
rush mat and a lamp. Our host, however,
proposed further hospitalities. We were well
supplied with water, then with a charcoal stove
for heating our soup, and finally with excellent
and spotlessly clean bedding. The arrival of
guests at so late an hour proved somewhat
disturbing to the domestic animals housed in
the courtyard, who crowed, and quacked, and
barked, and mewed, according to their nature.
Khalil came in to say good-night, the Bedu
to be paid, the gigantic negro to inquire after
our comfort, various black and white cats to
solicit alms; but finally all was quiet, and we
had not long to wait for sleep.</p>

<p>We were up betimes next morning, and enjoyed
an early toilet beside the Fâria, not
without a passing thought of pity for friends
in England, and the different conditions which
would make it less attractive there to rise at
half-past five on the 10th of January, and bathe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
in a mountain stream. We were in the rich
oasis of Karâwa, the Koreæ of Josephus, famous
in ancient times for the finest sugar-canes
known. Westward rose the great peak of the
Karn Sartabeh, towering 2227 feet above us,
although only 1243 feet above sea-level. This
was one of the chain of peaks upon which, in
old times (according to the Talmud), beacon
fires were lighted at the time of the new
moon, especially to proclaim the harvest and
thanksgiving festivals. The top is covered with
ruins, which, with much else in this practically
unknown district, we hope some time to explore
thoroughly.</p>

<p>Khalil, who had slept out all night, to take
care of his horses, complained loudly of the
cold; but our soldier, whom everyone here addressed
as "Haj," denoting that he had made
the Mecca pilgrimage, was quite cheery and
unashamed, probably much relieved that we had
entered no complaint of his incompetence at
the serai. Khalil assured us of his own entire
ability to take charge of the party; but as the
infallible Baedeker says that for the journey in
the west Jordan valley "an escort is indispensable,"
we decided to take our soldier on to
Jericho. His weapons, though rust-eaten,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
looked quite effective, and for anything we
knew his gun might really have gone off in
an emergency, or as the kind friend in Jerusalem
who provided part of our own armoury had advised,
when a good echo made it "worth while
to bang away."</p>

<p>The greatest interest to-day lay in the number
of Tells, which might well repay more careful attention
than has yet been bestowed upon them,
and which indicate that, in spite of the forcing-house
temperature of this district, it must have
been at one time fairly well populated.</p>

<p>Our curiosity was aroused by a group of large
birds perched on a rock at some little distance,
and apparently motionless. We shouted at them,
but they declined to rise. We discovered through
our field-glasses that they were vultures, at least
a score in number, and included a pair of
young ones, no bigger than hens, and of a
creamy white.</p>

<p>We were not long in reaching the pleasant
Ain Fesail, the head of the Wady Fesail, which
runs down into the Wady el Abyad, and meets
the Jordan in the valley some two or three miles
below. Here were wide green meadows, shady
trees, and abundance of water, which, for the
first time since last night's adventures, incited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
our horses to some return of cheerfulness. We
had time to linger and to explore the adjacent
ruins of Phasælis, and the animals were relieved
of all their encumbrances that they might enjoy
a roll in the fresh grass. The Lady rejoiced
especially on behalf of Sadowi, who had been
lately so much depressed that she had conceived
the theory that the journey, which, owing to
circumstances, had been slow, and therefore in
some respects tedious, had been too much for
him. She had even shown a sentimental desire
to walk up hills, had not the Doctor sternly refused
to remount her should she carry it into effect.
Whether a whole field of grass all at once had
the effect of intoxication upon a Jerusalem horse—the
chance of a lifetime—or whether it suddenly
dawned upon him that yonder were the hills of
Judæa, and that he was, therefore, within twenty-four
hours of home, we shall never know, but
the steady Sadowi suddenly threw care, not to
say respectability, to the winds, and started on
a <i>fantasia</i> of his own. He tore off like a war-horse
at sound of the trumpet, a hunter at sight
of the hounds, a saucy colt in the meadows. The
other horses, stimulated by evil example, executed
minor interludes; Khalil and the haj
scampered right and left, and one by one brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
in the truants, all but the ringleader, Sadowi,
who entirely refused to be caught, and we advised
Khalil to desist, in the hope that he would
return of his own accord. Some time later, a
shout from Khalil roused our attention, and we
saw him leading in a sedate and repentant
Sadowi by the halter. "He ran and ran from
me like the devil himself," explained his master,
with some confusion of ideas, "when all at once
he became afraid, and stood and trembled."
The Lady seized the occasion to express a hope
that this came from no recollection of previous
ill-treatment, upon which Khalil threw his arms
round the creature's neck, and kissed him
passionately. He kicked and swore at him a
few minutes later, but the horse seemed equally
indifferent to both processes.</p>

<p>The ruins close by are those of Phasælis, a
town which Herod the Great named after his
brother Phasælus, and which he presented to his
sister Salome, who left it to her friend, Julia Livia,
the wife of the Emperor Augustus. It stood
beside the excellent highroad which we had for
some time been following, and which seems to
have extended the whole way from Jericho up
to Cæsarea Philippi, at the foot of Mount
Hermon, and near the source of the Jordan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
probably bordered by a forest of palms, at one
time extensively cultivated here. The town has
no architectural beauty, but, like the twin town
of Archelais, is delightfully situated.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that we had not been advised
to make the slight detour up to the foot
of the hills to visit the ruins of El Aujeh, and
still more that we missed the caverns of Es
Sumrah, some ten miles south, described by
Tristram. They are sand-stone quarries, resembling
those known as Solomon's quarries in
Jerusalem, and have been worked so as to resemble
huge grottoes. Tristram counted fifty-four
pillars still left, and gives an interesting
description of the traces of the wild beasts by
which they are at present tenanted, and of the
bones of camels, oxen, and sheep, which had
been their victims.</p>

<p>The ride over the wide plain was exhilarating.
Some of the party could now press forward, as
we were nearing a more frequented district, and
even the Lady was convinced that there was no
need to spare the horses. As we neared Jericho
we found ourselves enveloped in a sudden dust-storm,
and had to give up certain schemes for
botanising in the neighbourhood. Even next
morning we were warned to be off without delay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
in order to secure good weather for the ride to
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The last scene of our drama reminded us,
effectually, that we had got back to "the cab-shafts
of civilisation," as represented by the
Turkish Government. We found the courtyard
of the Inn of the Good Samaritan crowded
with soldiers, and the level ground all about
with laden donkeys; while excited fellahin
shouted and cursed and quarrelled, or—a sight
rare and pathetic among Arabs—sat still. They
were peasants from the village of Bethany, returning
home with corn from Moab, and intercepted
by the tax-gatherers, who saw an
excellent opportunity for their business. One
poor wretch who had sought to escape them by
making his way round through the hills had
been seized, and was now in custody in the inn-yard.
The worthy host was absent, but was
efficiently represented by his two little boys, who
ought to have been playing marbles or whipping
tops, but were, instead, keeping up the character
of the establishment, and perfectly capable of dealing
with the problems before them, even to catching
the chickens and turkeys, and shutting them
up that they might not be robbed by the soldiers,
who were here to see that the peasants were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
effectually robbed by the tax-gatherers, while
they, the little boys, in turn showed considerable
experience in robbing their guests.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the continuity of
history and the homogeneousness of humanity it
is at least interesting to know that even now,
with all modern improvements of robbers licensed,
uniformed, and salaried, one may still go down
from Jerusalem to Jericho and be quite certain
of falling among thieves.</p>

<p>But the storm did not come. The sun was
bright, the air was clear, kind friends awaited us
in Jerusalem, and we were content to believe
that the desert of life has many oases:</p><div class="poetry-container">

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
